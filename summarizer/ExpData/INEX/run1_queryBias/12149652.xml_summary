To date she is the first cinematic Bond girl to officially marry secret agent Commander James Bond, though Bond would later marry again (though the second marriage was invalid) in John Gardner's Scorpius.
She was the first and so far, only, Bond girl  to ever marry James Bond (Kissy Suzuki and Anya Amasova have otherwise posed as his wives), as well as being one of the few Bond girls with whom it was strongly suggested that Bond was actually in love.
However, when George Lazenby declined to return as Bond, this was rendered unviable, as it would have meant either having two actors play Bond in Diamonds Are Forever or re-filming Tracy's death scene with the new actor as Bond, so the scenes were added to the end of On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
