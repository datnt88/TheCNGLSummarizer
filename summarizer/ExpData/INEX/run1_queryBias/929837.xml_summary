UltraEdit is a commercial text editor for Microsoft Windows created in 1994 by Ian D. Mead.
The editor contains tools for programmers, including macros, configurable syntax highlighting, code folding, file type conversions, project management, regular expressions for search-and-replace, a column-edit mode, remote editing of files via FTP, interfaces for APIs or command lines of choice and more.
After expiration of this period, the application will work only with a regular license key.
