Pyroclasts of different sizes are classified as volcanic bombs, lapilli and volcanic ash.
Ash is considered to be pyroclastic because it is a fine dust made up of volcanic rock.
During Plinian eruptions, pumice and ash are formed when silicic magma is fragmented in the volcanic conduit, because of decompression and the growth of bubbles.
