+ 6 \,^{1}_{0}\mathrm{n}In 1969, the Dubna team carried out chemical experiments on element 102 and concluded that it behaved as the heavier homologue of Ytterbium.
This is most definitely only an estimate since a true value can only be determined using a chemical compound of the element and no such compounds exist for nobelium.
Isotopes of nobelium have also been identified in the decay of heavier elements.
