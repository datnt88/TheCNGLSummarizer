All seasons of Seinfeld have been released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.
Unlike some other 1990s sitcom DVD releases, they contain quite comprehensive extras, including commentaries, a trivia track and short featurettes on a number of episodes.
The seasons have been sorted into 'volumes' for their DVD release, with seasons 1 and 2 forming 'Volume 1' (as there are only total 18 episodes between them), and each season thereafter being its own volume.
