Minifigures are small, plastic figural toys produced by Danish toy manufacturer Lego, which are customarily sold with Lego sets, as characters intended to populate modular Lego environments.
Although many Lego sets include minifigures, Lego also sells collections of minifigures separate from other sets.
Lego has also produced Bionicle figures, which are much larger in scale than any other Lego figure, and feature considerably more articulation.
