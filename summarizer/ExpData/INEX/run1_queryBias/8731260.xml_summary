Mark Bellinghaus (born July 20, 1963), is a Marilyn Monroe activist and a collector of Monroe memorabilia.
When he was 9, he saw a cut-out of Marilyn Monroe from  How to Marry a Millionaire ("where sheâ€™s in front of those three mirrors and looks so magnificent").
In 1995 Bellinghaus emigrated to the United States to study acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in Los Angeles, a city he chose because it was where Marilyn Monroe used to live (and the college because Monroe had attended the Lee Strasberg in New York).
