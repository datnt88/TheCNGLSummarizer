A typical 3-year (Full Time) PhD in the United Kingdom usually requires the submission of a maximum 80,000 word thesis; the entire study period would be spent researching the topic and writing the thesis.
In Ireland EdD programs have only recently been introduced and they tend to follow the UK model of initial research modules followed by longer research papers and thesis.
The dissertation presents the doctoral candidate's research and findings and is submitted for defense to the candidate's dissertation committee (Advisor/1st, 2nd, and 3rd reader).
