A volcanic ash column rose high into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states.
Everyone in the quiet zone could see the huge ash cloud that was sent skyward from St. Helens' northern foot.
In time ash fall from this eruption was reported as far away as Minnesota and Oklahoma, and some of the ash drifted around the globe within about 2Â weeks.
