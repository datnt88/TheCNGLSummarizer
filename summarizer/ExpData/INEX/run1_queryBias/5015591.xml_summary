Operation Meghdoot was seen by some as the blueprint behind the Kargil War in 1999 when Pakistan backed guerillas and paramilitary forces covertly occupied the Kargil region.
It is said that Operation Meghdoot was the inspiration for this abortive operation in Kargil launched by Pakistan later in 1999.
But while Operation Meghdoot was launched on an area that provided scope for some amount of ambiguity, the Line of Control in the Kargil region was clearly marked and therefore India received more international sympathy during the Kargil episode.
