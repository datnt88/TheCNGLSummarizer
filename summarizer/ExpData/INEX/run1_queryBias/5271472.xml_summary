It is a factual retelling of the true story of a teenage boy from Mt. Rainier Maryland who went through the rite of exorcism in 1943.
Since publication of the book, Allen has been a frequent guest on talk shows, entertainment shows and history shows that discuss exorcism in general, demonic possession and the Mt. Rainier case his book details.
Allen adopts a neutral point of view as to the reality of possession, preferring to let the facts and witnesses speak for themselves and allowing the reader or viewer to decide for themselves if such things are real.
