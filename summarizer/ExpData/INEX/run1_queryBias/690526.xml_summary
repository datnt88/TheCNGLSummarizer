In Great Britain, the summer of 1783 was known as the "sand-summer" due to ash fallout.
"This past week, and the two prior to it, more poison fell from the sky than words can describe: ash, volcanic hairs, rain full of sulfur and salt peter, all of it mixed with sand. The snouts, nostrils, and feet of livestock grazing or walking on the grass turned bright yellow and raw. All water went tepid and light blue in color and gravel slides turned gray. All the earth's plants burned, withered and turned gray, one after another, as the fire increased and neared the settlements."
This disruption then led to a most severe winter in 1784, where Gilbert White at Selborne in Hampshire reported 28Â days of continuous frost.
