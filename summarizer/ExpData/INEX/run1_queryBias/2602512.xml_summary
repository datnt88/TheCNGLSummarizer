The Australian Research Council (ARC) is the Australian Governmentâ€™s main agency for allocating research funding to academics and researchers in Australian universities.
Many Australian researchers and academics are critical of the ARC for what they perceive as its overly bureacratic processes.
There is broad support for the organisation on the basis that it has improved the public profile and accountability of research in Australia.
