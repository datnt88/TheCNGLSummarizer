SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 3, also known as SOX3, is a human gene.
This gene encodes a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of embryonic brain development and in determination of cell fate.
The encoded protein acts as a transcriptional activator.
