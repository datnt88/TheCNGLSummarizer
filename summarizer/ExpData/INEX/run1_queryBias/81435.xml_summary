Super Princess Peach marked the second time that Princess Peach was cast as the main hero in a video game, as Princess Peach had to save Mario and Luigi from King Bowser.
Finally, she also appears in the first Mario basketball game, Mario Hoops 3-on-3, for the Nintendo DS, and is a technical type (good at shooting).
In 2005, Nintendo used a new voice for Princess Peach.
