Although Luigi is a plumber, as his brother, other facets of his personality vary from game to game.
The game replaces Mario with Luigi in the main story as the game's protagonist, similar to New Super Mario Bros. Also, as in that earlier game, Luigi can jump higher than Mario, but has less traction on the ground.
Another Nintendo source in the form of Super Smash Bros. Brawl has a trophy of Luigi that states Luigi to be, "Mario's younger twin brother." However, Solid Snake's Codec conversation, as well as the Paper Luigi trophy, both state that Luigi is the younger brother, with Colonel Roy Campbell even calling Luigi a "kid brother." Despite the contradictory sources, Mario acts like a traditional older brother towards Luigi.
