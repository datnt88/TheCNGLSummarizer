When the alcohol reaches 40% the Armagnac can be transferred to large glass bottles called "Dame Jeanne" for storage.
As with any "eau de vie", Armagnac should be stored vertically to avoid damaging the stopper with alcohol.
Research conducted by scientists at Bordeaux University in 2007 suggested that Armagnac has health benefits, finding that moderate consumption can help protect against heart disease and obesity.
