The U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) reports that  "Although there is no evidence that alcohol itself is a carcinogen, alcohol may act as a cocarcinogen by enhancing the carcinogenic effects of other chemicals. For example, studies indicate that alcohol enhances tobacco's ability to stimulate tumor formation in rats.  In humans, the risk for mouth, tracheal, and esophageal cancer is 35 times greater for people who both smoke and drink than for people who neither smoke nor drink,  implying a cocarcinogenic interaction between alcohol and tobacco-related carcinogens."
"Considering total alcohol drinking, the relative risk for alcohol drinkers vs. nondrinkers was 1.3 â€¦ No relation emerged between duration of alcohol consumption and risk of endometrial cancer. These findings suggest a potential link between alcohol drinking and endometrial cancer risk and are, in any case, inconsistent with a protective role of alcohol in endometrial carcinogenesis."
A study found, "An index of total alcohol consumption showed a greater than two-fold risk for pancreatic cancer for heavy alcohol consumption (four or more drinksper day), primarily due to heavy beer and hard liquor consumption.
