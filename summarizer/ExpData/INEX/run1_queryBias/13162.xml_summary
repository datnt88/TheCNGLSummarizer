The most common culinary use for gelatin is as a main ingredient in varieties of gelatin desserts.
To make gelatin desserts, typically powdered gelatin is mixed with sugar, and additives such as adipic acid, fumaric acid, sodium citrate, and artificial flavorings and food colors.
Another vegetarian alternative to gelatin is carrageenan.
