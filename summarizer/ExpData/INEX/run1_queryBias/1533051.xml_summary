An eruption column consists of hot volcanic ash emitted during an explosive volcanic eruption.
Eruption columns form in explosive volcanic activity, when the high concentration of volatile materials in the rising magma caused it to be disrupted into fine volcanic ash and coarser tephra.
Particular hazards were the ingestion of ash stopping the engines, the sandblasting of the cockpit windows rendering them largely opaque and the contamination of fuel through the ingestion of ash through pressurisation ducts.
