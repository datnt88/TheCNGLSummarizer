SUGOCA (スゴカ, Sugoka) is a Japanese rechargeable contactless smart card ticketing system for public transport in Fukuoka Prefecture and the surrounding areas.
The name is an acronym of "Smart Urban GOing CArd", while sugoka (凄か, sugoka) in the Kyūshū dialect means "great".
Like other electronic fare collection systems in Japan, the card uses RFID technology developed by Sony Corporation, known as FeliCa.
