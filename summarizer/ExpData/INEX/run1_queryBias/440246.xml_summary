Historically, higher fuel efficiency was associated with lower traffic safety, intertwining the issues of fuel economy, road-traffic safety, air pollution, climate change, although this relationship fell increasingly into dispute.
In the mid 2000s, increasing safety of smaller cars and poor safety history of light trucks began to reverse this association.
However, vehicle safety ratings are now made available to consumers by NHTSA and by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
