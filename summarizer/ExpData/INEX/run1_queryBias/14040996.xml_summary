Additionally, Vijay Singh, who serves as the Eagles for St. Jude Ambassador, is personally donating $5,000 for every eagle he makes during the 2008 season and Camilo Villegas will donate $3,000 for each of his eagles.
Fans of the PGA and LPGA TOUR are encouraged to participate in the program by either donating per eagle carded by Vijay Singh, per eagle recorded by any PGA or LPGA professional on the tour, or by making a one-time donation to the Eagles for St. Jude program.
During the 2007 PGA TOUR, 1,222 eagles were made, which resulted in Stanford Financial Group donating $1,222,000 to the Eagles for St. Jude program.
