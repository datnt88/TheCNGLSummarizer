SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (campomelic dysplasia, autosomal sex-reversal), also known as SOX9, is a human gene.
The protein encoded by this gene recognizes the sequence CCTTGAG along with other members of the HMG-box class DNA-binding proteins.
It acts during chondrocyte differentiation and, with steroidogenic factor 1, regulates transcription of the anti-Muellerian hormone (AMH) gene.
