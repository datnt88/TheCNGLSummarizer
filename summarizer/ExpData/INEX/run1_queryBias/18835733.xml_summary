On July 5, 1999 David Osborne Hagger appeared by Statement 476 before the BSE Inquiry.
In 1991 a European Community Commission:"... expressed concerns about the possible transmission of the BSE/scrapie agent to man through use of certain cosmetic treatments."
Sources in France reported to the British Medicines Control Agency:"... that there were some licensed surgical sutures derived from French bovine material."  Concerns were also raised: "... regarding a possible risk of transmission of the BSE agent in gelatin products."
