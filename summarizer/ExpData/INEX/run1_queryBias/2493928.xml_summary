The first and most obvious symptom is what feels like a sharp stone, although this does not hurt, the pain occurs about 2-3 minutes after being stung.The pain from weever stings has been described as so severe that sailors stung by the fish would cut off their stung fingers or hands in a desperate attempt to relieve the pain, this is however highly unlikely.
Once the pain has eased the injury should be checked for the remains of broken spines and any found need to be removed.
Medical advice should be sought if any of the symptoms listed above as Rare/Severe are observed, if swelling spreads beyond the immediate area of injury (e.g. from hand to arm), if symptoms persist or if any other factor causes concern.
