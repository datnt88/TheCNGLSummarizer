The Gallo-Roman city was a forerunner of the re-established Merovingian town that is the ancestor of present-day Paris.
The regular grid-plan of Roman Lutetia marked it as the city, in the Gallo-Roman sense.
The new Roman governors and noblemen did build the city in a Roman style, but certainly used materials found locally.
