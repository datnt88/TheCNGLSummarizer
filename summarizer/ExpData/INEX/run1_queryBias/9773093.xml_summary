In March 2001 he participated in the farewell-concert of the famous Philharmonia Hungarica, which was closed by the German Government and the Orchestral Union for political reasons.
He appeared with orchestras such as the Royal Flanders Philharmonic (September 2001, Sumida Triphony Hall, Tokyo), Sarajevo Symphony Orchestra, and the Janacek Philharmonic; with the latter he gave the Austrian Premiére of Bruckner’s completed Ninth Symphony in Gmunden.
Today he is a well-known Bruckner-scholar, in particular due to his studies and editions on Bruckner’s Ninth Symphony.
