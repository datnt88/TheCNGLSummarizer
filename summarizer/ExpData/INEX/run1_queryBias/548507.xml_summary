A significant area at the head of the harbour has been reclaimed since the founding of Dunedin, primarily for industrial use.
The existence of the harbour was guessed by Captain Cook when he was off what is now the Dunedin Pacific coast in 1770.
This continued until the Scottish settlers arrived in 1848 and made Port Chalmers and Dunedin the new centres on the harbour.
