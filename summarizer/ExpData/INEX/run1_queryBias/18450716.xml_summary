Under conditions of moderate alcohol consumption where blood alcohol levels average 0.06-0.08 percent and decrease 0.01-0.02 percent per hour, an alcohol clearance rate of 4-5 hours would coincide with disruptions in sleep maintenance in the second half of an 8 hr sleep episode [2].
Low doses of alcohol (one 12 oz. beer) are sleep-promoting by increasing total sleep time and reducing awakenings during the night.
Previous experience with alcohol also determines whether or not alcohol is a "sleep promoter" or "sleep disrupter." Under free-choice conditions, in which subjects chose between drinking alcohol or water, inexperienced drinkers were sedated while experienced drinkers were stimulated following alcohol consumption [4].
