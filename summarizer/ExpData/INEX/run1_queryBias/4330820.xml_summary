The Gross Energy of a food, as measured by bomb calorimetry is equal to the sum of the heats of combustion of the components - protein (GEp), fat (GEf) and carbohydrate (GEcho) (by difference) in the proximate system.
where Dp, Df, and Dcho are respectively the digestibility coefficients of protein, fat and carbohydrate calculated as
These vary slightly depending on sources and Atwater derived weighted values for the gross heat of combustion of the protein, fat and carbohydrate in the typical mixed diet of his time.
