Regular expressions are used by many text editors, utilities, and programming languages to search and manipulate text based on patterns.
He later added this capability to the Unix editor ed, which eventually led to the popular search tool grep's use of regular expressions ("grep" is a word derived from the command for regular expression searching in the ed editor: g/re/p where re stands for regular expression).
On the other hand, there is a simple mapping from regular expressions to nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) that does not lead to such a blowup in size; for this reason NFAs are often used as alternative representations of regular expressions.
