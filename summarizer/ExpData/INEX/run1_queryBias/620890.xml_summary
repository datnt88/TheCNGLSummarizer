Albert Charles Paul Marie Roussel (April 5 1869 - August 23 1937) was a French composer.
While his early work is strongly influenced by impressionism, he eventually found a personal style which was more formal in design, with a strong rhythmic drive, and with a more distinct liking for functional tonality than is evident in the work of his more famous contemporaries (for instance Debussy, Ravel, Satie, and Stravinsky).
Arturo Toscanini included the suite from the ballet Le festin de l'araign√©e in one of his broadcast concerts with the NBC Symphony Orchestra.
