The first actual human beings to be digitally duplicated were Marilyn Monroe and Humphrey Bogart in a March 1987 film created by Daniel Thalmann and Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann for the 100th anniversary of the Engineering Society of Canada.
An actor has little legal control over a digital clone of him/herself and must resort to database protection laws in order to exercise what control he/she has.  (The proposed U.S. Database and Collections of Information Misappropriation Act would strengthen such laws.)  An actor does not own the copyright on his/her digital clone unless he/she was the actual creator of that clone.
The use of a digital clone in the performance of the cloned person's primary profession is an economic difficulty, as it may cause the actor to act in fewer roles, or be at a disadvantage in contract negotiations, since the clone could be used by the producers of the movie to substitute for the actor in the role.
