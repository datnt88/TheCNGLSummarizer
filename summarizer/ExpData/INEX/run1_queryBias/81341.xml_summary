When the later Mario Tennis game, Mario Power Tennis, came out, Nintendo decided against bringing Toad back into the game alongside Birdo, Baby Mario and Donkey Kong Jr, though he did appear as a cameo with Toadette in the opening movie.
He also appears in the Arcade mini-game Mansion Patrol.
Additionally, Toad is one of the 256 Catch Cards in the game.
