"Life" was the FYR Macedonia's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, performed in English (the first time the Macedonian entry had not featured at least some of the country's native language) by To≈°e Proeski.
Proeski sings about the need to make the most of life ("Life is a book and you gotta read it/Life is a story and you gotta tell it") and appears to be mourning the end of a relationship ("Roaming through my old emotions/I find new feelings of misery").
The song is more well-known for its unusual performance, which began with Proeski ostensibly alone on stage.
