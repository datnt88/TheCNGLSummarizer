The Apple Newton, or simply Newton, is the iPhone's predecessor and was an early line of personal digital assistants developed and marketed by Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) from 1993 to 1998.
Although the Apple Newton was produced for six years, it was never as successful in the marketplace as Apple had hoped.
Before the Newton project was canceled, it was "spun off" into an Apple wholly owned subsidiary  company, Newton Inc., but was reabsorbed several months later when Steve Jobs ousted Apple CEO Gil Amelio and resumed control of Apple.
