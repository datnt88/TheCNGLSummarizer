Many cultures and religions contain some concept of demonic possession, but the details vary considerably.
Demonic possession is mentioned at length in Carlos Castanedaâ€™s The Active Side of Infinity, in which it is claimed that human civilization is demonic in origin.
End of Days (1999) shows another form of demonic possession suggested by Hilarius.
