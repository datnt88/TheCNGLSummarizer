The Battle of Tololing was one of the pivotal battles in the Kargil War between India's armed forces and troops from the Northern Light Infantry who were aided by other Pakistan backed irregulars in 1999.
The Indian army's casualties on the Tololoing peak were half of the entire losses in the whole war.
The 3 week assault finally culminated with India taking control of the peak and changing the course of the war.
