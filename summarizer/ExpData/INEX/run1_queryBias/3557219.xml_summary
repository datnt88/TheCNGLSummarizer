During an MRI, a large cylindrical magnet creates a magnetic field around the head of the patient through which radio waves are sent.
A distinction is therefore made between "MRI imaging" and "functional MRI imaging" (fMRI), where MRI provides only structural information on the brain while fMRI yields both structural and functional data.
The positron emitting radioisotopes used are produced by a cyclotron, and chemicals are labelled with these radioactive atoms.
