Baird had an older half-brother, John Lennon (9 October 1940 â€“ 8 December 1980) who was born during her mother's marriage to Alfred Lennon, and an older half-sister, Ingrid Pederson (born Victoria Lennon, 19 June 1945, after Julia's affair with a Welsh soldier, but who was given up for adoption in 1945) and a younger sister, Jacqueline 'Jacqui' Dykins (born 26 October 1949).
Baird worked as a special needs teacher, and after Lennon's death she wrote John Lennon, My Brother (with Geoffrey Giuliano) and gave up working in 2004 to write Imagine This - Growing up with my brother John Lennon.
Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards.
