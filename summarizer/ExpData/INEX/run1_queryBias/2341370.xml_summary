This is a list of current motifs on the banknotes of different countries.
The customary design of banknotes in most countries is a portrait of a notable citizen on the front (or obverse) and a different motif on the back (or reverse) - often something relating to that person.
One exception to this is the euro banknotes, where non-existent architectural structures have been chosen to avoid the impression of a national bias.
