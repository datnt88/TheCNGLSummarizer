Brazil is currently divided into five regions (also called macroregions) by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE).
These divisions are composed of states with similar cultural, economical, historical and social aspects, and although through the scientific point of view information given by this type of division is not very accurate, because official information given by the IBGE uses this system, this division is the most widely used in Brazil.
