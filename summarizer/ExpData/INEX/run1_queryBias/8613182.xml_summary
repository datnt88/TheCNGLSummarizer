No record of this encounter was preserved in the National Archives of Australia or in the Army or RAAF files.
Although government reports are held by some researchers, to date they have never been released.
Witnesses and researchers were surprised when "The Sun News-Pictorial" (a tabloid) ran no story, yet "The Age" (a broadsheet) did.
