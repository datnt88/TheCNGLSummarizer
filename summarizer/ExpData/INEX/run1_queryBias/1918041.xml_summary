Phantom limb pain is the feeling of pain in an absent limb or a portion of a limb.
The neuromatrix theory aims to explain how certain activities associated with pain lead to the conscious perception of phantom pain.
Phantom pain may arise from abnormal reorganization in the neuromatrix to a pre-existing pain state (Melzack, 1992).
