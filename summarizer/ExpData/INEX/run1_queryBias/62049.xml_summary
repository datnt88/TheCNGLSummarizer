The Main North Line from Picton to Christchurch and the Main South Line from Lyttelton to Invercargill via Dunedin together comprise the South Island Main Trunk Railway.
Commuter trains operated multiple routes around Christchurch and Dunedin, plus a service between Invercargill and Bluff.
The final services to operate ran between Dunedin and Mosgiel, and they ceased in 1982.
