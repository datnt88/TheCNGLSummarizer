TextWrangler is a popular text editor for Mac OS X from Bare Bones Software.
It was originally a commercial product, but (beginning with version 2.0) has become the freeware alternative to their flagship editor, BBEdit, and the successor to their previous freeware editor, BBEdit Lite.
TextWrangler's find and replace allows the use of regular expressions, Python, Perl, and shell scripts can be run directly in the program.
