After the war ended, the division moved to Thailand, where it disarmed the Japanese occupying army, and liberated and repatriated Allied prisoners of war.
The Division first saw action during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1948, where it fought and captured some territory in the Poonch sector.
In 1999 during the Kargil War, the division was sent as a reinforcement to the Gultari area.
