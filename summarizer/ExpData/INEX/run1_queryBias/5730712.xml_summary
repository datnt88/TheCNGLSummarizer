Like Suica and ICOCA, the underlying technology behind PiTaPa is Sony's FeliCa smart card system.
The concept to introduce a smart card fare system in the Kansai region was first announced in July 7, 2001 by the Surutto KANSAI Conference.
PiTaPa can be used in place of an ICOCA card if the user charges money on to the card beforehand.
