Televoting or televote is also the term used to describe the telephone voting in the Eurovision Song Contest, as well as for World Idol, American Idol and similar contests.
Televoting is the sole voting avenue in the Eurovision.
During the mid-nineties, the European Broadcasting Union, organiser of the Eurovision Song Contest, introduced telephonic and SMS voting for competing entries in place of national juries.
