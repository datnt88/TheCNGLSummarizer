For Gaul before the Roman conquest, see Gaul.Roman Gaul consisted of an area of provincial rule in the Roman Empire, in modern day France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and western Germany.
The Gaulish language and cultural identity would, in the five centuries between Caesar's conquest and the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, undergo a syncretism, and evolve into a hybrid Gallo-Roman culture.
The Gallo-Roman, or Vulgar Latin, dialect of the late Roman period evolved into the dialects of the OÃ¯l languages and Old French in the north, and Occitan in the south.
