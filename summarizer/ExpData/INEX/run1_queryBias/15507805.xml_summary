"SeinfeldVision" is the first episode of the second season of 30 Rock and the twenty-second episode of the series.
Seinfeld wore a wig in the episode to make him look more like the character version of Jerry Seinfeld.
Lisa Schmeiser of Television Without Pity graded this episode as a "B+." Rick Porter of Zap2it thought that this episode "started off [''30 Rock'''s] second season on a pretty strong note." Porter said that this episode wasn't the best episode of 30 Rock but it was still "one of the sharpest and wittiest comedies on television." Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that "SeinfeldVision" "was a really funny beginning to the second season." Sassone also notes that the appearance of Seinfeld did not feel like stunt casting.
