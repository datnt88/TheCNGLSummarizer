Chondromalacia Patella (also known as CMP, Patello-femoral Pain Syndrome, or Runner's Knee) is a term for a large and disparate group of medical conditions that can cause pain at the front of the knee.
It is often simply an overuse injury.
The treatment will depend on the specific source of a person's pain.
