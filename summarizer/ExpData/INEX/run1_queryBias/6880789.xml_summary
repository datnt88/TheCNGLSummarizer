myki (pronounced IPA: ) is the name of the contactless smartcard ticketing system to be introduced on public transport in Victoria, Australia. myki is designed to replace a number of ticket systems in Victoria, primarily the current Metcard (metropolitan Melbourne) and V/Line (regional) ticketing systems.
In February 2008 Victorian Public Transport Minister Lynne Kosky announced that the full roll out of the system would not begin until the end of the year.
The Minister for Public Transport has instructed the TTA to focus the application of myki for transport fare payment before endeavouring on other retail concepts.
