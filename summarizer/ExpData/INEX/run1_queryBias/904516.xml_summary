Although airport ground crews regularly clean up runways, the crash of Air France Flight 4590 demonstrated that accidents can still occur: in that case, the crash was caused by debris left by a flight that had departed only four minutes earlier.
On 24 June 1982, British Airways Flight 9 on route to Perth, Australia flew into a volcanic ash cloud over the Indian Ocean.
Flight 9 dived down until it exited the cloud allowing the airborne ash to clear the engines, which were then restarted.
