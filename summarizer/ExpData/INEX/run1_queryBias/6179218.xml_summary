1:18 scale is a common reference to Diecast Replicas that are 1/18th the size of the real thing.
Typically, companies that produce model cars will have licensing arrangements with real car manufacturers to make replicas of their cars, both in current production or of discontinued models.
Often, cars featured in collectible car magazines (such as Collectible Automobile) were soon the subjects of 1:18 diecast models.
