The International Association for the Study of Pain has divided CRPS into two types based on the presence of nerve lesion following the injury.
Precipitating factors include illness, injury and surgery, although there are documented cases that have no documentable injury to the original site.
By testing various hypotheses, these researchers hope to discover the unique mechanism that causes the spontaneous pain of RSDS and that discovery may lead to new ways of blocking pain.Other studies to overcome chronic pain syndromes are discussed in the pamphlet "Chronic Pain:  Hope Through Research," published by the NINDS.
