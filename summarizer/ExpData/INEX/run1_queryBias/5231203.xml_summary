George Toogood Smith (1903â€“5 June 1955) was the maternal uncle, through marriage, of John Lennon.
Smith told Lennon that words did not have to be taken at face value, as they had many different meanings, which Lennon would later use in his writing.
After Smith's death, Lennon insisted on wearing a large overcoat that had belonged to Smith, and even though it became worn and threadbare, Lennon wore it throughout his art college years.
