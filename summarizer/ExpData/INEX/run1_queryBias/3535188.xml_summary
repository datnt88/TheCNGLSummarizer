"The Stake Out" is the second episode of the first season of the NBC comedy Seinfeld.
Although it was the third episode to be filmed (after "The Seinfeld Chronicles" and "Male Unbonding"), it was the second episode to be broadcast.
When the episode was first repeated, on December 2, 1992, a special introductory film was made featuring Louis-Dreyfus and Seinfeld, claiming that this episode was the first that they did together.
