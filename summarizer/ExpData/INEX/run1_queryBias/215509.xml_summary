They recommend a diet high in protein (19–35% energy) and relatively low in carbohydrates (22–40% energy), with a fat intake (28–58% energy) similar to or higher than that found in Western diets.
The high protein and low-carbohydrate diet recommended by Loren Cordain and colleagues—i.e. about 56–65% of food energy coming from animal foods and 36–45% from plant foods, with 19–35% of energy derived from protein, 22–40% from carbohydrates and 28–58% from fat—based on the dietary patterns of worldwide modern-day hunter-gatherers has attracted a number of criticisms, including the following:
Critics have questionned the notion that preagricultural hunter-gatherers would have generally consumed a low-carbohydrate and high-protein diet.
