Pyroclastic material with particles less than 2 mm in diameter is referred to as volcanic ash.
Rounded tephra balls are called accretionary lapilli if they consist of volcanic ash particles.
Accretionary lapilli are formed in an eruption column or cloud by moisture or electrostatic forces, with the volcanic ash nucleating on some object and then accreting to it in layers before the accretionary lapillus falls from the cloud.
