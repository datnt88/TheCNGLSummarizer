Although grep is not strictly an acronym, the letters are taken from global / regular expression / print, a series of instructions for the ed text editor.
For simplicity, these examples match a single English word, but regular expressions can be extremely sophisticated (and notoriously difficult to decipher, or write-only).
The word "grep" has also become a synonym for regular expressions themselves.
