As a gesture of goodwill India decided not to try 93,000 (80,000 military, paramilitary and police forces, and 13,000 civilians) Pakistan prisoners of war for war crimes and released them.
The agreement has been the basis of all subsequent bilateral talks between India and Pakistan, though it has not prevented the relationship between the two countries from deteriorating to the point of armed conflict (most recently in the Kargil War).
Just like India's invasion of Siachen Glacier was a violation of the Simla Agreement by India, the 1999 Kargil War was a violation by Pakistan and therefore aberrant international conduct by both sides.
