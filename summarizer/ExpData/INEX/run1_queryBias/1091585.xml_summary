Fuller was born  in Kingston, Jamaica and began his career with Tivoli Gardens before moving to English club Crystal Palace in February 2001 for £1million, after impressing on trial during January.
Fuller scored on his Preston debut, a 2–1 defeat at home to old club Crystal Palace, and soon became a vital team player.
In four games, he scored two goals, collected two yellow cards and one red card in the 2–2 draw at Crystal Palace (one of his former clubs), for a hand gesture at the crowd.
