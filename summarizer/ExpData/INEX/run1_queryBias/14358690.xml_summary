The Maison Carr√©e, in Nimes,built in 16-19 B.C., is one of the best-preserved Roman temples in the former Roman Empire.
It was built according to the principles of Vitruvius, the chief theorician of Roman architecture.
It was built to contain what was believed to be the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, which was discovered in a Gallo-Roman crypt in Saint-Maximin in 1279.
