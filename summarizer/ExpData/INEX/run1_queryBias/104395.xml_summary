He was taught chemistry by Anders Gustaf Ekeberg, the discoverer of tantalum.
In order to aid his experiments, he developed a system of chemical notation in which the elements were given simple written labels—such as O for oxygen, or Fe for iron—with proportions noted by numbers.
Berzelius is credited with identifying the chemical elements silicon, selenium, thorium, and cerium.
