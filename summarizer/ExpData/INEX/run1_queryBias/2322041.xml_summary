Scientific research around the world conducted by governments, health agencies and universities has, over decades, been able to demonstrate a causal relationship between alcohol beverage advertising and alcohol consumption.
The European Union and World Health Organization (WHO) have both specified that the advertising and promotion of alcohol needs to be controlled.
Advertising cannot promote brands based on alcohol content or its effects.
