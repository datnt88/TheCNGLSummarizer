Demons and demonic possession are generally considered to be a Medieval belief.
A Catholic priest can perform a "minor" exorcism in the home, but a "major" exorcism requires the consent of the local bishop.
Since demons and demonic possession are largely perceived as a mix of quaint superstition and urban legend, the role of the exorcist and the Christian demonologist has waned dramatically in the wake of the Age of Enlightenment.
