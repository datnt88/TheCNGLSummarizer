In Alien³, Weyland-Yutani's name appears on screen several times written in Japanese.
He is played by Lance Henriksen, the actor that played the android Bishop in Aliens and Alien³, suggesting that the android was modeled after him.
In the novelization of Alien³ (released before Alien vs. Predator), it is said that the Bishop android was created by a Weyland-Yutani employee named Michael Bishop, who is seen in the third film.
