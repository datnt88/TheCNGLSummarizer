The Kargil War, also known as the Kargil conflict,(I) was an armed conflict between India and Pakistan that took place between May and July 1999 in the Kargil district of Kashmir.
Recently however, Pervez Musharraf revealed in his memoirs that Pakistanâ€™s nuclear delivery system was not operational during the Kargil war; something that would have put Pakistan under serious disadvantage if the conflict went nuclear.
After the end of the war however, the Indian Government increasingly called it the "Kargil War", even though there had been no official declaration of war.
