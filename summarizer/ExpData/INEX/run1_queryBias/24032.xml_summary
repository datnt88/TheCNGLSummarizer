PET scans are increasingly read alongside CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, the combination ("co-registration") giving both anatomic and metabolic information (i.e., what the structure is, and what it is doing biochemically).
Due to the short half lives of most radioisotopes, the radiotracers must be produced using a  cyclotron and radiochemistry laboratory that are in close proximity to the PET imaging facility.
The presence of the small on-site cyclotron promises to expand in the future as the cyclotrons shrink in response to the high cost of isotope transportation to remote PET machines
