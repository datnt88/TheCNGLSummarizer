The New York Crystal Palace was crowned by a dome 100 feet in diameter and, like the original Crystal Palace, was constructed from iron and glass.
In 1854 another building directly inspired by The Crystal Palace, the Glaspalast in Munich, was inaugurated.
The New York Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire on 5 October 1858.
