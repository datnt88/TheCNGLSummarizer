In Alien vs. Predator (2004), which serves as a prequel to the Alien series, Henriksen plays Weyland Industries chief executive officer Charles Bishop Weyland.
In the previous film, Alien (1979), Ripley is attacked by her android crewmate, Ash (Ian Holm); Ripley is at first disturbed by Bishop's presence, but comes to accept and trust him.
The portrayal of androids in the Alien series — Ash in Alien, Bishop in Aliens and Alien 3, and Call (Winona Ryder) in Alien Resurrection (1997) — has been studied for its implications relating to how humans deal with the presence of an "Other", as Ripley treats them with fear and suspicion, and a form of "hi-tech racism and android apartheid" is present throughout the series.
