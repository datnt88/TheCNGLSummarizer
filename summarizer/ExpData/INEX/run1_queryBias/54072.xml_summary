If the note has been printed incorrectly, i.e. by a counterfeiter, these numbers may appear poorly aligned.
On each of the 7 denominations of the banknote, there is a small six-character printing code which uniquely identifies the printing information of each banknote.
The fifth character, a letter and sixth character, a number, represent the row and column, respectively, of the particular banknote on the particular plate.
