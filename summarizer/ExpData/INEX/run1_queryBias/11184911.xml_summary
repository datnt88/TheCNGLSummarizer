In Silver-gelatin photography, the emulsion consists of silver halide crystals suspended in gelatin, and the substrate may be glass, plastic film, paper or fabric.
Other polymer macromolecules are often blended, but gelatin has not been entirely replaced.
The silver halide is actually being 'peptized' by the gelatin.
