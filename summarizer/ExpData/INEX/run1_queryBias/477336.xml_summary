The United States twenty-dollar bill ($20) is a denomination of United States currency.
U.S. President Andrew Jackson is currently featured on the front side of the bill, which is why the twenty-dollar bill is often called a "Jackson," while the White House is featured on the reverse side.
The twenty-dollar bill is the primary banknote (and in most cases, the only banknote, as it would increase costs to make ATMs compatible with other bills) dispensed by ATMs in the United States as well as the primary bill used for withdrawals or cashing checks.
