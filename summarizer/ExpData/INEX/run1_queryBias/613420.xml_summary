According to the Atkin's diet, the low carbohydrate content of pork rinds makes them more nutritious than some low-fat snack foods, such as high-carbohydrate, fat-free pretzels.
Moreover, although there is some protein present in pork rinds, the quality of that protein, called hydrolyzed gelatin protein, is quite low.
Because they have a protein efficiency ratio lower than 40% as dictated by the FDA, their nutrition label usually states "0%" in % Daily Value or "Not a significant source of protein" as recommended by the FDA.
