The "classic" ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate.
This contains 245 calories, 4 g protein, 2 g carbohydrate and 24 g fat (24:6 = 4:1).
Achieving the balance of fat, protein and carbohydrate can be difficult; patients may consume the appetising protein (meat) and leave or vomit the fat.
