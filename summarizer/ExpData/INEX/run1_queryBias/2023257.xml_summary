The Lives of John Lennon is a 1988 biography of musician John Lennon by Americanauthor Albert Goldman.
Concerning the author's account of Lennon's consumption of LSD, the New York Review of Books said: "Goldman's background research was either slovenly or nonexistent." As such, The Lives of John Lennon was extremely controversial upon its release because of its portrayal of Lennon in a less-than-admiring light.
Goldman implies that Mark David Chapman's murder of John Lennon may have been part of a conspiracy by Fundamentalist Christians.
