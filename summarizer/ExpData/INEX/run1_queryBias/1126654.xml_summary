Many items of the Gallo-Roman period have been found locally, particularly coins (including 2 gold Gallic coins found in 1839).
The archaeological diggings around the Ducal palace(in the grounds of the present abbey) in 1973-1984 revealed some evidence of  the La Tiene Celtic  culture and Gallo-Roman works.
Two Gallo-Roman cemeteries have also been discovered.
