Servbot (Kobun in Japan, which roughly means "little follower") are a series of characters from the Mega Man Legends'' series.
However, by Mega Man Legends 2, the Servbots begin to treat Mega Man more kindly (though still antagonistically), thanks in part to their mother's crush on Mega Man.
Servbots are similar in appearance to little Lego figures and are often referred to as "Lego People" for that reason.
