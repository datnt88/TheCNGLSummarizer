A pyrocumulus or fire cloud is a dense cumuliform cloud associated with fire or volcanic activity.
Phenomena such as  volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and occasionally industrial activities can induce formation of this cloud.
This is a process not fully understood as yet, but is probably in some way associated with charge separation induced by severe turbulence, and perhaps, by the nature of the particles of ash in the cloud.
