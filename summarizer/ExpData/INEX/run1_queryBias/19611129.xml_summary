In 1994, the band issued their first album Blunt Nails In A Sharp Wall on self-released cassette.
In 2000, Sleepy People changed their name to Blue Apple Boy (a name apparently based on Masonic imagery).
The band’s tone became less fanciful and more sinister with a second single, “Freak” on the band’s own Bad Apple Records.
