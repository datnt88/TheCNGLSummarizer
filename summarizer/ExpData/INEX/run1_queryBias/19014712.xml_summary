King's Field II is the second game in the King's Field RPG series.
Like both its successors and predecessor, the game is played through first person view in a dark and mysterious, medieval fantasy setting.
The game was developed by the Japanese game development company From Software, and released July 21st, 1995 in Japan, and December 31, 1995 in the U.S.  Since the first King's Field game was never published outside Japan, King's Field II is commonly known simply as 'King's Field' in the U.S. It has only been released for the Playstation console.
