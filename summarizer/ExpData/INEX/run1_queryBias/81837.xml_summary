The Crystal Palace was enlarged and stood from 1854 until 1936, when it was destroyed by fire.
This is often confused with a 550-metre pneumatic passenger railway which was exhibited at the Crystal Palace in 1864, which was known as the Crystal Palace pneumatic railway.
The Crystal Palace was the prototype for several other buildings, including the New York Crystal Palace of 1853, the Glaspalast in Munich of 1854, and the Pal√°cio de Cristal in Porto of 1865.
