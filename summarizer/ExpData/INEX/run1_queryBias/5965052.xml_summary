Clone Bricks are imitation LEGO Bricks, such as Mega Bloks, Tyco bricks, and others.
They are generally considered to be of lower quality and cheaper than LEGO brand bricks, though many will bind with LEGO bricks.
The Lego Group has sought to put an end to clone bricks and retain sole manufacturing rights over the Lego Indicia.
