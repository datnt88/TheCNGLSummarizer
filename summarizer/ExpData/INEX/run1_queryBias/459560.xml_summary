The "Stillman Diet" is a high-protein, low-carbohydrate and low-fat diet.
The low-carbohydrate advocates did some adjustments of their own increasingly advocating controlling fat and eliminating trans fat.
For example, contrary to popular belief that low-carbohydrate diets damage the heart, one study found that women eating low-carbohydrate, high-fat/protein diets had the same or slightly less risk of coronary heart disease, compared to women eating high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets.
