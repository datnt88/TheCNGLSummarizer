This is a list of theatrical animated feature films produced and/or released by Walt Disney Productions/The Walt Disney Company:
The canon includes animated features that were or are being produced entirely by Walt Disney Animation Studios, formerly known as Walt Disney Feature Animation (and previously as part of Walt Disney Productions).
Walt Disney Animation Studios once announced that Home on the Range (released April 2 2004) would be the last traditionally animated film, and from Chicken Little (released November 4 2005) onwards, all future Walt Disney Animation Studios films would be computer-animated.
