Banana production in Honduras plays an important role in the Economy of Honduras.
The Honduran banana industry employed a significant Garifuna workforce from the Bay Islands off Trujillo and in 1901 the government gave concessions for them to use over 7,000 hectares for banana cultivation.
This FHIA banana crop is resistant to major diseases and pests, but is also highly highly productive and efficient.
