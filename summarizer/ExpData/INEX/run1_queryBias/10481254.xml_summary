Practically alone of all major Bond Girls of the Fleming canon, Gala Brand has not appeared as a character in a James Bond film, the movie version of the novel being an almost total rewrite of the book Moonraker''.
After Drax interrogates Bond and Gala, Bond uses a blowtorch with his mouth to burn through the wires restraining Gala.
Gala is the most professional of all of Fleming's Bond Girls, being practically the only one to have an independent career.
