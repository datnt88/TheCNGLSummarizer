Nissan's Infiniti marque had been using Q as the name for sedans (the Q45) and SUVs (the QX4 and QX56) since 1989.
Despite its multiple airbags and safety electronics, such as ESP, Q7 scored only four stars out of five in the Euro NCAP crash test.
In the USA, however Q7 got five stars out of five from the NHTSA safety test for both front and side impacts.
