Dr. Christmas Jones is a fictional character from the James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough. She was portrayed by Denise Richards. The character also appears in the novel The World Is Not Enough and the video game The World Is Not Enough. The character's name follows in the tradition of other Bond girls names that are double entendres,  such as Pussy Galore.

Dr. Christmas Jones is a young American nuclear physicist working in Azerbaijan to dismantle nuclear warheads so as to reduce the Russian inventory in line with treaty obligations. She tends to be rather defensive and even aggressive towards the men she meets. She particularly dislikes jokes about her given name.

On their initial encounter Christmas distrusted Bond, who was working undercover to investigate Renard's presence at a Russian missile facility. When Christmas realized that Bond was not who he claimed to be, she alerted both the authorities and, unintentionally, Renard; as a result, Renard was able to escape with a nuclear warhead. Once she learned of Renard's plot to destroy the pipeline, Christmas assisted Bond in his mission. In classic Bond-movie fashion, she became highly attracted to him, and they have sex after the end of the mission, prompting Bond's comment "I thought Christmas only comes once a year."

Denise Richards has stated that she liked that her character was a Bond girl that was both brainy, athletic, and had depth of character, in contrast to Bond girls from previous decades. However, Richards was criticised as not being credible in the role. The character's outfit of a tank top and shorts was remarked upon in reviews of the film.

Christmas Jones was ranked as the worst Bond girl of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2008.
