Kitaca (キタカ, Kitaka) is a rechargeable contactless smart card ticketing system for public transport in Sapporo, Japan. Hokkaidō Railway Company (JR Hokkaidō) will introduce the system from autumn, 2008. Its name means "the card of north (北, kita)", while 北 is also the first character of Hokkaidō (北海道, Hokkaidō). Like other electronic fare collection systems in Japan, the card uses RFID technology developed by Sony corporation known as FeliCa. The card has an official mascot of Ezo momonga (pteromys volans orii), a kind of flying squirrel found in Hokkaidō.

55 stations in Sapporo area, including unmanned stations, will accept Kitaca. 

Prepaid card and commuter pass will be issued. JR Hokkaidō is also considering on functions such as electronic money, credit card, or mobile payment.

The card will have an integration service with JR East's Suica. The service with SAPICA, a smart card system to be introduced by Sapporo City Transportation Bureau from January 2009, was also considered. However, the latter service was canceled because of the cost.
