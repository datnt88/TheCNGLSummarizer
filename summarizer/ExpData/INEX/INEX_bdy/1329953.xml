Notepad++ is a free source code editor for Windows. The project is hosted on SourceForge.net, from where it has been downloaded over eight million times.

This project, based on the Scintilla editor component, is written in C++ with pure Win32 API calls and uses STL. The aim of Notepad++ is to offer a slim and efficient binary with a totally customizable GUI.

Furthermore, users can define their own language by using the built-inUser Language Define System, which makes Notepad++ extendable, tohave syntax highlighting and syntax folding.

Some of its features include:

It has support for macros and plugins.  A user-written plug-in called TextFX, which provides many text transformation options, is included by default.

Although Scintilla does not support multiline regular expression search and replace, Notepad++ does contain support for plug-ins which help mitigate this fact.

Notepad++ is available only for the Microsoft Windows operating system. However, users can still get Notepad++ to work on other platforms, like Linux and Mac OS X, using software such as Wine.
