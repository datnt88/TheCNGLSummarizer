myki (pronounced IPA: ) is the name of the contactless smartcard ticketing system to be introduced on public transport in Victoria, Australia. myki is designed to replace a number of ticket systems in Victoria, primarily the current Metcard (metropolitan Melbourne) and V/Line (regional) ticketing systems. 

myki will also operate on local bus services in many regional centres, including Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, and Warrnambool. The Skybus Super Shuttle Melbourne Airport service (with its own, premium fares) will also accept myki. The myki system is being provided by Kamco (Keane Australia Micropayment Consortium), a wholly owned subsidiary of the American company Keane Inc.

Work on a replacement public ticketing system in Victoria commenced in Late 2002 the Department of Infrastructure erected a display of smartcard ticketing systems by various vendors were put on display at Flinders Street Station. In June 2003 the Transport Ticketing Authority was established to procure and manage a new system, with a request for tenders for what was then called the 'New Ticketing Solution' were released in July 2004.

The request for tender closed in October 2004, with ten tender offers were received from six bidders, with four bids short-listed in December 2004. In March 2005 two companies had been short-listed for the final stage of the tender process: Keane Corporation (with Ascom and Downer Engineering) and Manta.T (with ADI Limited, MTR Corporation and Thales).

On July 12, 2005 the Kamco consortium was selected to develop the system, winning a $494 million contract due for completion by 2007. The consortium was made up of Keane Inc, Ascom, ERG, and Giesecke &amp; Devrient Australasia. The tender process was the subject of a number of  concerns in December 2007, with the Victorian Auditor-General Des Pearson requesting police investigate the leak of tender documents. Draft reports from the Auditor-General's investigation referred to backdated documents and inconsistent treatment of bidders, but independent reports by Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Avanti Consulting in 2005, as well as the Victorian Auditor-General found that the integrity of the tender process had not been compromised.

The system began with a pilot program, that was due to begin in early 2007, but was delayed by approximately a year. More than 20,000 pieces of equipment have since been installed, with civil engineering works continuing. A majority of the metropolitan Melbourne bus and tram fleet has had its wiring completed. 

In February 2008 Victorian Public Transport Minister Lynne Kosky announced that the full roll out of the system would not begin until the end of the year. By March the same year, the minister said that the system would not be operational until 2010. In April 2008, the Transport Ticketing Authority announced that it had stopped paying service payments to the Kamco consortium after April 2007, as a result of the project not being delivered on schedule. 

The first field trial of myki was held on the Geelong bus network in late 2007. The trial identified problems with "front office" computer software. In May 2008 Kamco conducted Regional Bus Pilot 1 in Geelong, where ninety percent of tests were passed. According to Kamco's report on Regional Bus Pilot 1, it demonstrated "Essential onbus activities such as scan on and scan off, top up myki, purchase of short-term tickets using cash or myki money, driver log on / off, route and shift selection and GPS connectivity and accuracy performed well. Back office processes and operational procedures such as end-to-end data transaction flows, generation of reports, training, communications, installation and commissioning were generally good. The operator (McHarry's Buslines) was pleased with the NTS training, performance and ease of use of the myki solution." Further field tests across other transport modes during the second half of 2008, including an additional test on regional buses were planned. 

In August 2008 testing began on the Melbourne suburban train and tram networks. The train tests involved Kamco staff at East Camberwell, Canterbury, Chatham and Mont Albert stations, while on trams special services on route 86 not open to normal fare-paying passengers were used. These tests were all single mode, with multi-modal trips to be tried at a later date.



myki gives customers the best fare for the way they travel and fares will continue to be based on the time-zone fares currently used under the Metcard system. myki will store monetary value (myki money) and travel days (myki pass). myki money calculates the best fare for the user's trip as they scan on and scan off throughout the system and caps to the applicable 2 hour, daily or weekly (Monday - Sunday) fare.

myki will be able to be purchased from:

myki will need to be topped up as the stored value diminishes along the way.  This can be done in the same variety of ways as stated above.  One can also register myki and have it linked to a bank account to automatically top up when the stored value reaches a certain level.

As customers travel with myki they scan on at the beginning of their journey and scan off at the end at fare payment devices called myki scanners. myki can be scanned through a wallet or purse, but the wallet or purse needs to held against the scanner as scanning only works occasionally or not at all when the card is in a pocket, laptop bag or handbag. If myki is not scanned off at the completion of a journey a default fare is likely to be charged. Scanning off at the end of a journey is necessary for some rail journeys currently, but scanning off at the end of a tram or bus journey is new.

The Minister for Public Transport has instructed the TTA to focus the application of myki for transport fare payment before endeavouring on other retail concepts.

Many users can choose to register their myki or elect to have it remain anonymous. 



There will also be the option of purchasing a temporary, disposable short term ticket which is valid for travel on the day of purchase only.

Criticisms have been raised about the necessity of photo IDs on concession cards as a potential invasion of privacy with some groups as non-concession cards do not require photo ID. Disability groups have questioned why the current system of separate photo ID that is presentable at the point of inspection cannot be retained. Requiring photo ID on concession cards will also hamper the ability of interstate concession holders to use the myki system.

The myki system is designed to calculate the "Best Fare" for a commuter (i.e., if you travel more than once in a day, your 2-hourly fare will become a daily, being cheaper than 2 x 2-hourly fares). This automatic "Best Fare" system applies only up to weekly fares. Periodicals of up to 365 days can be pre-loaded using value-adding machines.  At present it appears that the 'Best Fare' calculation will only be available on the metropolitan system.

A roaming discovery centre, a specially designed semi-trailer is touring various locations throughout Victoria for public and staff familiarisation.

A second stationary discovery centre is located at Southern Cross Station.  It was opened by Minister for Transport, Lynne Kosky on Thursday, 8 March 2007.  The centre was then open to the general public from Friday, 9 March 2007.

According to Minister Kosky's announcement, the site at Southern Cross Station includes "... a series of interactive, visual, auditory and tactile activities including staff demonstrations, DVD displays and interactive learning experiences."

The Southern Cross Station centre will initially be 7am-7pm, Monday to Friday, and 9am-5pm on weekends and public holidays.  As an educational facility, the discovery centre will be open for approximately 12 months, though its role may change during and after that time as the Transport Ticketing Authority begin to issue mykis.

The site costs $100,000 a year to rent from the station authority.

The proposed system is intended to have the following benefits:

As the program has not yet been released, it is not yet confirmed whether these changes will actually have the effects on the system claimed by the ticketing authority.  It is expected that early in the system's release, surveys will be performed to confirm the success of the program's release.

The myki ticketing system has been criticised on a number of grounds:
