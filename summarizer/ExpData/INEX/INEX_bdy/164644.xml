Albert Ghiorso (born 15 July 1915) is an American nuclear scientist who helped discover numerous chemical elements on the periodic table. 

He was born in Vallejo, California and grew up in Alameda, California.  As a teenager, he built radio circuitry and earned a reputation for establishing radio contacts at distances that outdid the military. Albert Einstein was his idol scientist.

He received his  BS in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1937.  After graduation, he worked for a company that produced emergency communication devices, and invented the world's first commercial Geiger counter, which evolved into his participation in the Manhattan Project.

He was introduced  to Glenn T. Seaborg through a mutual friendship between their wives who also worked as secretaries at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory.  (Likewise, Helen Griggs Seaborg was Ernest Orlando Lawrence's secretary when she met Glenn Seaborg.)

Seaborg and Ghiorso's collaboration was most fruitful in the early days of the cyclotron, when its results were hard to identify and detect.  Their work resulted in many elements being discovered at UC Berkeley, and Ghiorso is credited with having co-discovered the following elements:

Before the mishap about the discovery of element #118 in 2000, the element was proposed to be named Ghiorsium by his colleagues.
