Hayakaken (はやかけん, Hayakaken) is a rechargeable contactless smart card ticketing system for public transport in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. Fukuoka City Transportation Bureau will introduce the system from spring 2009. Its name stands for quick (速い, hayai), friendly (優しい, yasashii), comfortable (快適, kaiteki), and card (券, ken). Hayakaken (速かけん, Hayakaken) also means "Because it's quick" in Kyūshū dialect. Like other electronic fare collection systems in Japan, the card uses RFID technology developed by Sony corporation known as FeliCa.

From spring 2009, all lines of Fukuoka City Subway, namely Hakozaki Line, Kūkō Line, and Nanakuma Line will accept the card.

There will be unregistered card, registered card, and commuters pass. The latter two can be reissued if a user lost them. The card will also function as electronic money.

There are two other systems in Fukuoka. One is nimoca, a system introduced by Nishi-Nippon Railroad (Nishitetsu) from May 18, 2008. Another is SUGOCA, a future system to be introduced by Kyūshū Railway Company (JR Kyūshū) from spring 2009. The three cards in Fukuoka and Suica, a card already used in Greater Tokyo Area by East Japan Railway Company (JR East), will have integrated services from spring 2010.
