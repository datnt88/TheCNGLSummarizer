"The Masseuse" is the seventy-third episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld. This was the 9th episode for the 5th season. It aired on November 18, 1993.

Elaine dates a man who shares the name of notorious serial killer Joel Rifkin and tries to convince him to change his name. Jerry's girlfriend, a masseuse (Jennifer Coolidge in an early role), seems unwilling to give Jerry a massage, even as she takes Kramer as a client. Meanwhile, she is not fond of George, leading him incessantly to wonder why, even to his neglect of his own girlfriend (Lisa Edelstein, also in an early role). Eventually, Jerry goes insane and angrily forces his girlfriend to give him the massage.
