The International Business Leaders Forum (IBLF) is an organisation which promotes responsible business, particularly in emerging economies. It is backed by over 100 multinational companies, including BP, Volkswagen, The Coca-Cola Company and Vodafone.

IBLF was created in 1990 by The Prince of Wales and a group of international chief executives as a response to the changing face of globalisation, and in particular the fear that business was having a negative impact on society. It started work in central and eastern Europe - helping to stabilise society following the collapse of Communism, but now works in emerging markets globally.

The International Business Leaders Forum partners with leading businesses to inspire and realize sustainable enterprise and global development.  In a world where trust and reputation are vital to sustainable business and relationships, IBLF enables business to connect its aspirations for global citizenship to opportunities on the ground.

E. Neville Isdell, Chairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company:“We have found IBLF to be a dynamic, forward looking organisation, capable of anticipating emerging issues and contributing thoughtfully to how we manage those issues through the Coca-Cola system.”

IBLF focuses its expertise on the critical business issues of:

Leadership &amp; Exchange - connecting senior executives throughout its global corporate network &amp; enabling businesses to respond to new trends and innovations, identify mutual opportunities, and share good practices.

Profile &amp; Branding - using its platforms to highlight partners and their sustainable business activities as examples for other companies, business partners, employees, consumers, regulatory authorities and media.

Smarter Risk Management - identifying emerging social challenges across markets that could impact profitability and reputation, and developing proactive strategies to help business manage these risks.

Business Standards - promoting improved standards for the environment, human rights, transparency, and diversity as a means to sustainable growth for business and communities.

Public-private partnerships - facilitating multi-sector partnerships with government authorities, NGOs and companies to address local economic and social challenges.

Since 1999, IBLF has engaged major footwear manufacturers, the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Government of Vietnam, NGOs, and health and safety specialists in a partnership to improve the working conditions in the footwear industry.

Across Central and Eastern Europe, IBLF has helped hundreds of companies to respond to the changing role of business in society since the collapse of communism.

Following the UK government's 2005 Commission for Africa, IBLF helped set up Business Action for Africa, a coalition of international businesses committed to eradicating poverty in Africa.

The Prince's Youth Business International operated as part of IBLF from when it was set up in 1999 to its independence in 2008 - supporting the entrepreneurship of disadvantaged young people on six continents through seed funding, skills training, and business mentoring by IBLF Corporate Partners. The YBI network has helped to create 90,000 new businesses since its foundation.
