Mario Golf is a sports video game series that was developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo.  It began on the Nintendo 64 with two games, one for the N64 and the other for the Game Boy Color.  Since then, there have also been releases of one game on both the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance. In addition, both NES Open Tournament Golf and Mario Golf for the Nintendo 64 have been re-released for the Virtual Console.

The N64 and Game Boy Color versions can communicate each other via Transfer Pak connectivity, and the GameCube and GBA versions can do the same via the Nintendo GameCube-Game Boy Advance cable. Players can upload characters and data into the other game.
