James Bond (also known as I Wish I Was James Bond) will be the sixth and final single from Scouting for Girls' debut album, Scouting for Girls. 

It is also the tenth track on the album, and on the album version it is followed by a hidden track called Michaela Strachan. The song is about the spy James Bond from Ian Fleming's books and the James Bond movies. It is expected to be released late October/early November, presumably to coincide with the UK release of the 22nd Bond movie, Quantum of Solace. 

The music video was released onto youtube on September 24 2008, it has the band playing in tuxedos on a white stage whilst there are men and women dancing to the side of the band.
