Birkbeck station is a railway station and light rail stop in the London Borough of Bromley in the southern suburbs of London. It is located on Elmers End Road (A214) and alongside Beckenham Crematorium. 

The line was opened as a double-track branch of the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway in 1858, but was closed from 1915 until reopened on March 2 1930 as part of the Southern Railway electrification scheme. At the same time this new station was opened, to serve a growing suburban area, and named after one of the roads nearby. The tracks in the station are located well above street level; the buildings were damaged by fire in 1983. The two lines served are each single track, running together on the site of what was once a double track railway line. The northern railway line is served by a high level platform to the north of the track, whilst the southern light rail line is served by a low level platform to the south of the track. Each platform has its own access from the street, and the only access between the two platforms is via the street, with a fence between the two tracks to deter any attempt to cross the lines.

The one platform Tramlink stop opened in 2000, with the rest of route 2 to the Croydon loop. A proposed line alternative through Birkbeck station from Crystal Palace railway station to Beckenham Junction was considered for conversion to a Tramlink route but Transport for London has dropped the plan on the grounds that the  existing rail service is adequate.
