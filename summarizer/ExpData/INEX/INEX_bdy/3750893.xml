Diakonos is a customizable, usable curses-based (console-based, or text-based) text editor.  It was developed with the intention of being easier to configure and use than Emacs, more powerful than Pico and Nano, and not as cryptic as vi or ex.

Diakonos uses the common Macintosh/Windows keyboard shortcuts - Ctrl-C to copy, Ctrl-V to paste, Ctrl-O to open a file, Ctrl-S to save and so on, instead of the more idiosyncratic key combinations used by most other console-based editors.

Diakonos is a Ruby program, and hence needs Ruby installed.
