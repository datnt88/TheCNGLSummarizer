Melodi Grand Prix 2008 (shortened MGP 2008) is the television show in which the Norwegian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 is chosen.

There were 3 semi finals held, where televoting decided the top four songs. The top two of each semifinal went to the final, and the songs who were placed 3rd and 4th went to the 'Second Chance' semi final. 6 songs progressed to the final through the semifinals, with 2 songs progressing from the 'Second Chance' round. A mixture of jury and televoting selected the winner, which went on to represent Norway at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008.

The winner was Maria Haukaas Storeng with the song "Hold On Be Strong".  

Per Sundnes was the host of all five shows.
