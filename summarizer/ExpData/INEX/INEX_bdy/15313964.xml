The Estonian 25 Krooni bill (25 EEK) is a denomination of the Estonian currency . Anton Hansen Tammsaare, who was a famous Estonian writer of classical literature (1870-1940), is featured on the front side of the bill, which is why the 25 Krooni bill is often called a "Tammekas or Tammsaare".

A  view of Vargam√§e is featured on the reverse side of the bill. The 25 Krooni bill is one of the primary banknotes (and in most cases, the main banknotes to be used in everyday shopping) dispensed by ATMs in Estonia as well as the primary bill used for withdrawals or cashing checks. It is, therefore, one of the highest denomination note most commonly used by Estonians on an everyday basis.
