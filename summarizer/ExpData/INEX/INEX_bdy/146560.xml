A brickfilm is any film made using LEGO, Mega Bloks, or other similar plastic construction block toys. They are most often created with stop motion, though many CGI, 2D animation, and live action films are also considered brickfilms. 

The first ever brickfilm was made between 1985-1989 in Perth, Western Australia by Lindsay Fleay. The film was called The Magic Portal. The film itself is considered the forunner of modern brickfilms. A link to the video is in the Related Links section. The movie was shot on [16mm film] with a [bolex] camera and has a total runing time of 16 minutes 11 seconds. Brickfilming now is usually shot with a digitall camcorder because of its ease and use. 

The brickfilming hobby has spawned several online communities, including Bricks in Motion and Brickfilms LLC.
