EMA 2007 was the television show in which Slovenia selected its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. The final will took place in Ljubljana on the 3rd February 2007, with semi finals on the 1st and 2nd. Unlike in 2006, the winner was selected through televoting only.

Previous contests involved selecting the winner through televoting and votes given by the preselected jury, which has raised some concearns and disputes over fairness of votes and questions "if this is really what public wants".
