Main article: Indigenous AustraliansThis List of Indigenous Australian group names contains names and collective designations which have been applied, either formerly or in the past, to group of Indigenous Australians.

Note: It is very important to be aware that the term tribe is really not very useful in indigenous Australia. There are very few cases where there are clear groups that correspond to such a term. In reality most indigenous Australians could name a number of groups of which they are members, each group being defined on different criteria and often with much overlapping. Many of the names listed below are properly understood as language or dialect names, some are simply the word meaning 'man/person' in the associated language,  some are autonyms (i.e. the name as used by the people themselves), some are exonyms (i.e., names used by one group for another, and not by that group itself), while others are terms for people from a specific area.

For further detailed overview and descriptions of some of these groups, see Indigenous peoples of Australia
