T-money is a rechargeable series of cards and other "smart" devices used for paying transportation fares in and around Seoul and other areas of South Korea. T-money can also be used in lieu of cash or credit cards in some convenience stores and other businesses.

Similar to its predecessor "Seoul Bus Card", T-money can be used to pay for bus, subway and some taxi fares. T-money is accepted by:

Some stores and attractions including Lotte World amusement park, Kyobo Book Centre, GS 25 and other selected convenience stores accept T-money as cash.

T-money cards cost 2500 won and can be purchased and recharged at stations, banks, convenience stores and kiosks located adjacent to bus stops. Self-service recharge machines are also available. Cards can easily be scanned while within a purse or wallet, but can be damaged if bent or otherwise subjected to unnecessary force.

There are two types of discount cards available for sale, one for teenagers (age 13~18) and the other for children (age 7~12). You need proper ID such as a Youth Card or Student ID in order to purchase these cards. Discount cards must be registered via the Internet within 7 days after first use which needs a user name and a National ID number or Foreigner registration number. Senior citizens are entitled to free transport and can pick up free tickets at counters in subway stations.



Smaller, more durable T-money cards with a thread for easy attachment to cellphones are also available, at around 5000 won. Watches, dolls, MP3 players, portable memory, ring, and bands containing T-money chips are also on sale.
