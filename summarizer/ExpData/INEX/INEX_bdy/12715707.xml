Block-style figures are a type of collectible toy action figures marked by a generally simplistic representation of the human form, usually comprised of block-shaped apendages and torsos. Generally, the block-style figures are no bigger than two to three inches in height.

The first widely produced block-style figures were arguably released by LEGO in 1974 and known as "minifigures". Since their advent, multiple forms of the block-style figure have arisen in the collectible toy market.
