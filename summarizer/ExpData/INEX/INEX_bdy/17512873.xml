The Mobile Giving Foundation is a non-profit organization based in Washington, working to increase mobile donating in the US.  The organization in early 2008 fostered a deal between the top four major US carriers, allowing non-profit text message fees to be waived.   

The Mobile Giving Foundation in conjunction with the  United Way, Mobile Accord, and mGive launched the first major mobile donating campaign during  Super Bowl XLII.  This was the first time a non-profit mobile donating camping had its fee’s waived from all major US carriers that didn’t involve a major natural disaster.

Currently the Mobile Giving Foundation has plans to or is currently working with the United Way, PBS, ASPCA, Keep a Child Alive, IFAW and Amnesty International.

The Mobile Giving Foundation is headed by Jim Manis, who’s background includes mobile campaigns to help Hurricane Katrina victims and the  Indonesian tsunami.  Jim also was a founding member of M-Qube, a mobile content company.  The Mobile Giving Foundations board consists of Jim Manis, Jenifer Snyder, and Laura Marriott.  

The Mobile Giving Foundation collects all money donated to charities through wireless carriers.  Carriers currently partnered with the Mobile Giving Foundation pass 100% of donations through to the nonprofit.  The Mobile Giving Foundation then takes 5% to 10% of the donations to cover messaging and short code costs and 90% to 95% of donations are passed on to the non-profit organizations running the campaigns.     

Mobile Giving Foundation is currently funded by QUALCOMM , 1024 Wireless Services, Acta Wireless, Hook Mobile, Mobile Accord, and VeriSign.
