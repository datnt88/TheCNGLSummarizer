Serbia and Montenegro participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twice, from 2004 (see Eurovision 2004). This entry was a success, the country finishing second with the performance of Željko Joksimović. In 2005, the second performance fared 7th, courtesy of the band No Name from Podgorica, Montenegro.

No Name were close to becoming the national entry once more, for the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest in Athens, however since their 2005 win of the national qualifier had been disputed due to tactical voting by the Radio-Television of Montenegro jury, and since the 2006 vote saw a repeat of this, the UJRT, the national union of broadcasters, did not reach an agreement on sending them to the contest again. On 20 March, 2006, Serbia and Montenegro officially withdrew from the ESC. The country did however participate in the final voting for the winner. The Eurovision semifinal was not broadcast in Montenegro in 2006, and so the votes from Serbia &amp; Montenegro, were actually from Serbia alone.

Both countries sent separate entries to the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, after the Montenegrin referendum on independence and dissolution of the state union in June 2006.
