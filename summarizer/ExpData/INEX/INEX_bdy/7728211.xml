All seasons of Seinfeld have been released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. Unlike some other 1990s sitcom DVD releases, they contain quite comprehensive extras, including commentaries, a trivia track and short featurettes on a number of episodes. The seasons have been sorted into 'volumes' for their DVD release, with seasons 1 and 2 forming 'Volume 1' (as there are only total 18 episodes between them), and each season thereafter being its own volume.

While the box sets listed below are the predominant retail versions, variations have occurred:
