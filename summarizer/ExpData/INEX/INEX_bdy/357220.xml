This is a list of theatrical animated feature films produced and/or released by Walt Disney Productions/The Walt Disney Company: 

The following is a list of the fifty feature films that are part of the Walt Disney Animation Studios canon, also known as the Walt Disney Animated Classics. The canon includes animated features that were or are being produced entirely by Walt Disney Animation Studios, formerly known as Walt Disney Feature Animation (and previously as part of Walt Disney Productions). Not included are live action films that feature animation, spin-offs from Disney television shows, the direct-to-video films produced by the DisneyToons studio in Australia (some of which received theatrical releases), or the Pixar films.  Walt Disney Animation Studios once announced that Home on the Range (released April 2 2004) would be the last traditionally animated film, and from Chicken Little (released November 4 2005) onwards, all future Walt Disney Animation Studios films would be computer-animated. However, this changed in July 2006, when a new traditionally animated film, The Princess and the Frog, was revealed to be in development.
