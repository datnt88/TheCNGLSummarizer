Menlove Ave. is a John Lennon album, posthumously released in 1986 under the supervision of Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow.

The album itself comprises session outtakes from the Rock 'n' Roll sessions with Phil Spector in late 1973, which comprises the first half of Menlove Ave. (save for "Rock and Roll People" which was cut in August 1973).  The remainder features rehearsal recordings in mid-1974 for Walls and Bridges.

The title refers to Lennon's childhood home, 251 Menlove Avenue, in Liverpool. Menlove Avenue is a long road in South Liverpool, part of the Liverpool ring road. While it is mainly residential, it is also a primary route - the A562.

The artwork for the release was effected by artist Andy Warhol, just months before his 1987 death.

Failing to chart in the UK, Menlove Ave. managed to only reach #127 in the US, making it Lennon's least-successful charting album.
