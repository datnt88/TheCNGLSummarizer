The Estonian 500 Krooni bill (500 EEK) is a denomination of the Estonian currency . Carl Robert Jakobson, who was an Estonian politician, publisher, writer and promoter of agriculture (1841-1882), is featured on the front side of the bill, which is why the 500 Krooni bill is often called a "Jakobson".

A barn swallow in flight on a landscape background is featured on the reverse side of the bill. The 500 Krooni bill is one of the primary banknotes (and in most cases, the main banknotes to be used in everyday shopping) dispensed by ATMs in Estonia as well as the primary bill used for withdrawals or cashing checks. It is, therefore, one of the highest denomination note most commonly used by Estonians on an everyday basis.
