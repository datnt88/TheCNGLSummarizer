A cooking apple is an apple that is used primarily for cooking rather than eating fresh. Cooking apples are larger, and can be less sweet and more sour than eating varieties. Some varieties have a firm flesh that doesn't break down too much when cooked. Only the British grow a large range of apples specifically for cooking. For example the French tend to use eating apples for cooking purposes. Some apples are dual-purpose, often becoming sweeter and softer under storage.

Cultivars can be divided into apples which are cooked whole (or in large segments) in the oven and become soft and fluffy and those which retain their shape. These apples are often aromatic (e.g. Newton Wonder or Peasgood Nonesuch). Other variety such as Bramley or Golden Noble are cut into small segments for pies, tarts etc. Bramley is by far the most popular cooking apple in the UK, as it grows easily to a large size, keeps well and cooks well. However the flavour is sharp and simple and it has limited aroma compared to, for example, Golden Noble.

Apples can be baked in an oven and served with custard or put into an apple pie or apple crumble. In the UK apples are boiled and mashed and served as apple sauce with roast pork.

A baked apple is one that has been baked in an oven until it has become soft. The core is usually removed and often stuffed with fruits, brown sugar, raisins, or cinnamon.

Often people have cooking apple trees and are swamped with apples in September. They often give the apples away to anyone who wants them, sometimes by taking them to work in plastic bags and leaving them on the kitchen table. Care should be taken when preparing "free" apples as they often have grubs (worms) inside.
