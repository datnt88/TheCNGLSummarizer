This article is about the smart card ticket system.  For the computer assembler, see Pasmo.  

Pasmo (パスモ, Pasumo) is a rechargeable contactless smart card ticketing system for public transport introduced in Tokyo, Japan from March 18, 2007. 



Pasmo is a development of the Passnet (パスネット, Pasunetto) system used by many non JR railway lines in the Tokyo region. The system offers interoperability with the JR Suica system, as well as integrates private bus companies into the existing Passnet network. 

The technology is based on RFID technology developed by Sony corporation known as FeliCa. Pasmo is available as a credit-card sized card.

Because of stronger than expected demand, general sales of the Pasmo cards were halted in April, less than one month after their introduction, in order to produce more cards. Approximately three million cards were sold before the restriction was enacted, of an allotment of just four million. Sales of regular Pasmo cards resumed on September 10, 2007. Until this date, only Pasmo commuter rail passes could be purchased.

Most railway operators introduced the system simultaneously when Pasmo started.





1 Chiba Urban Monorail will introduce the system from 2009. :2 It is unclear when Kanto Railway will introduce the system.

Bus and tramway operators will introduce the system gradually after Pasmo started.





On April 11, 2007, it was announced that sales of Pasmo fare cards would be limited to commuter rail pass purchases until August due to extremely high demand. It was originally predicted that approximately 2 million Pasmo cards would be sold in the first month, but about 3 million were actually sold, and stocks of Pasmo cards were running out.
