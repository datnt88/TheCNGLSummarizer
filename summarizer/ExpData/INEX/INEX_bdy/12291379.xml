Andorra was represented by Marta Roure and the song "Jugarem a estimar-nos". The Andorran National Final was held on March 15, 2004, hosted by Pati Moln√© and Xavier Graset with the winner being chosen by a mixture of an "expert" jury (5/7), SMS voting in Andorra (1/7) and SMS voting in Catalonia (1/7).The one who is going to represent Andorra at the 49th Eurovision Song Contest was chosen in the televised show "12 Points". 40 artists of the tiny country of Andorra participated in a talent scouting after which the public picked six of them by televoting to go through to the next round. About 16.000 televotes were cast, which is a lot considering the fact that Andorra only has about 72.000 inhabitants.

Before the final there was a series of quarter-finals and semi-finals. In each of the quarter-finals, 2 songs were presented with one being eliminated. In the 2 semi-finals, 3 of the winning songs from the 6 quarter-finals were presented, with one going forward to the final. The voting was a mixture of an "expert" jury (5/7), SMS voting in Andorra (1/7) and SMS voting in Catalonia (1/7). The two songs were performed by both Marta Roure and Bis a Bis. There was a separate vote to select the singer for the ESC - Marta Roure won by 5 votes to 2. Marta Roure was a clear favourite.

At Eurovision, the singer had a very subtle performance with simple choreography. Marta Roure came 18th at the Eurovision Semi-Final. It was the first Andorran entry for the Eurovision Song Contest.
