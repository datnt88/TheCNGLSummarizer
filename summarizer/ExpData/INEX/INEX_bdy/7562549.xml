The ACS National Historic Chemical Landmarks Program was launched by the American Chemical Society in 1992 and has recognized 60 landmarks to date.  The project is part of the ACS Division of the History of Chemistry and has the aim of compiling "an annotated roster for chemists and chemical engineers, students, educators, historians, and travelers."
