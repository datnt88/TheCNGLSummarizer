SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 14, also known as SOX14, is a human gene. 

This intronless gene encodes a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of the cell fate. The encoded protein may act as a transcriptional regulator after forming a protein complex with other proteins. Mutations in this gene are suggested to be responsible for the limb defects associated with blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and Mobius syndrome.
