Solanum aculeastrum is commonly known as Soda Apple, Sodaapple Nightshade, Goat Apple, Poison Apple, or more ambiguously as "bitter-apple". It is a poisonous nightshade species from Africa and not related to true apples. The term "soda apple" probably derives from "sodom apple", modified due to the fruit's detergent properties.

It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa south to South Africa, in a wide range of soil, terrain and climatic conditions. It is highly-branched and reaches 1-5 m high, with numerous sharp hooked brown thorns. The leaves are ovate, up to 15 cm long and 13 cm broad, with lobed margins and a downy underside. It flowers (in South Africa) from September to July, peaking from November to March. The petals are white to pale violet surrounding the ovary. These yield to fruit from April to January, peaking in June and November. These smooth, round berries are 6 cm in diameter and fade from green to yellow as they ripen. These berries contain high levels of the poisonous alkaloid solanine. The species name aculeastrum refers to the thorns that adorn most parts of the shrub.

Because of its dense growth and prickly nature, goat-apple is used as a hedge and living barrier for containing livestock. The Soda Apple is often used as a soap replacement, as it is high in saponin. Traditional Zulu practices use the fruit - fresh, boiled, or charred - in herbal medicine to treat a wide variety of afflictions including cancer, toothaches, and ringworm.

The Soda Apple has been described under a range of junior synonyms, now invalid. Several of these are ambiguous homonyms:

The botanist Bitter distinguished a number of subspecies and varieties of the Soda Apple, but these are not considered valid taxa anymore:
