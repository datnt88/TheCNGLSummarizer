Criticism of sport utility vehicles is the expression (made by various groups, organizations or individuals) of disapproval of sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Criticism may focus on risks posed to other road users or to the environment by the larger SUVs, and often asserts that benefits to the vehicle owner are illusory or exaggerated. 

One source of SUVs' popularity is the perception of significant safety advantages over smaller vehicles,. To this, critics claim that SUVs are more likely to roll over, more likely to be in a single-car accident and more likely to cause harm to other road users. 

The high center of gravity of SUVs makes them more prone to rollover accidents than lower vehicles, especially if the vehicle leaves the road or in emergency maneuvers. Figures from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  show that most passenger cars have about a 10% chance of rollover while most SUVs have between 14% to 20% (varying from a low of 14% for the AWD Ford Edge to a high of 23% for the FWD Ford Escape). Many modern SUVs are equipped with electronic stability control (ESC) to prevent rollovers on flat surfaces, but 95% of rollovers are "tripped" - meaning the vehicle strikes something low, such as a curb or shallow ditch, causing it to tip over. ESC may however prevent the vehicle reaching the trip point.

The Ford Excursion pioneered the use of the blocker bar, a kind of under-vehicle roll bar designed to keep the vehicle from rolling over anything unfortunate enough to be hit by it. 

Older SUVs are typically built with a truck-style chassis with separate body, whereas many newer models are similar to cars, which are typically built with a monocoque unitary construction (where the body actually forms the structure of the car). Separate chassis style designs are typically much less safe for the occupants than unitary construction.

The British television Fifth Gear program staged a 40 mph (64 km/h) crash between a previous generation Land Rover Discovery, which features a separate chassis and body, and a modern Renault Espace IV, which features unitary construction. Due to a technical fault, readings from the on-board instrumentation was unavailable, so the program had to speculate, based on the appearance of the vehicles after the impact, that the structural design of the Discovery offered less driver/passenger protection than that in the 2003 multi-purpose vehicle with unitary construction from Renault.

It must be noted that the Land Rover tested was the previous generation, which was based on the 1960s design of the original Range Rover. The new Discovery III features unitary construction. The Renault Espace IV achieved the highest score of any car ever when Euro NCAP tested it shortly after its introduction in 2003.

Because of SUVs' greater height and weight and rigid frames, it is contended by a columnist writing in The New Yorker magazine that SUVs can affect traffic safety. This height and weight, while perhaps giving an advantage to occupants inside the vehicle, often poses a risk to drivers of smaller vehicles in multi-vehicle accidents, particularly side impacts.  In 2003 and 2004 in the US, passenger cars were involved in 1.65 and 1.58 fatal crashes per 100M miles respectively compared to 2.14 and 2.05, nearly 30% more, for light trucks (SUVs pick-ups and vans).  In 2004, light trucks were involved in fatal, 2 vehicle crashes with passenger cars (4,765 total, 0.435 per 100M miles) at nearly 3 times the rate as passenger cars (2,422 total, 0.149 per 100M miles).  In the same year, light trucks were involved in fatal, 2 vehicle crashes with motorcycles (869 total, 0.079 per 100M miles) at a nearly 75% greater rate than passenger cars (738 total, 0.045 per 100M miles).  The same year, light trucks were involved in fatal, 2 vehicle crashes with large trucks at a 3.9% greater rate than passenger cars.  Fatal crashes between 2 light trucks occurred at nearly the same (but greater) rate as fatal crashed between 2 passenger cars.

In parts of Europe, effective 2006, the fitting of metal bull bars, also known as grille guards, brush guards and push bars to vehicles such as 4x4s and SUVs is illegal (pedestrian safe rated plastic bars and grilles may be used). Bullbars are often used in Australia and parts of the United States to protect the vehicle from being disabled should it collide with wildlife.

Because of their unconventional body proportions, SUVs can create visibility problems for other drivers by obscuring their view of traffic lights, signs, and other vehicles on the road, plus the road itself. SUV drivers also suffer from poor visibility to the side and especially to the rear; similarly, driving a low-built vehicle alongside an SUV blocks the driver of the low vehicle's view in the direction of the SUV. This has led to many "backover deaths" where SUVs run over small children when backing out of driveways. The problem of backover deaths became so widespread that rear facing backup cameras were installed on some SUVs so that the driver could see behind the vehicle..  Australia's NRMA motoring organisation has tested a number of vehicles  and the results show that poor rearward visibility is by no means confined to any one type of vehicle.

Steel bumpers are also used by Off Roaders and Overlanders to protect the vehicle while not on pavement. This is a compromise for highway driving though as these bumpers are heavy.

The wider bodies of larger SUVs means they occupy a greater percentage of road lanes, leaving less room for error. This is particularly noticeable on the narrow roads sometimes found in dense urban areas.  SUVs also have difficulty fitting in some parking spaces and encroach further into traffic lanes when parked along side the road.

Manufacturers have added car-level bumpers to reduce the possibility of the other vehicle(s) sliding under the SUV in a collision.

SUV safety concerns are compounded by a perception among some consumers that SUVs are safer for their drivers than standard cars. According to G. C. Rapaille, a psychological consultant to automakers (as cited in Gladwell, 2004), many consumers feel safer in SUVs simply because their ride height makes "[their passengers] higher and dominate and look down (sic). That you can look down [on other people] is psychologically a very powerful notion." This and the height and weight of SUVs may lead to consumers' false perception of safety (Gladwell, 2004).. It is true that the additional visibility afforded by an elevated driving position can, if the driver uses it, have a beneficial effect on safety.

In a study in Wellington, New Zealand, it was found that SUV drivers were 55% more likely to drive with only one hand on the top of the steering wheel than drivers of standard vehicles. This was considered indicative of a false sense of security compared to the drivers of smaller cars.  

Gladwell also noted that the SUV popularity is also a sign that people began to shift automobile safety focus from active to passive, to the point that potential SUV buyers will give up extra 30 ft (9.1 m) of braking distance because they believe they are helpless to avoid a tractor-trailer hit on any vehicle. Such notion of safety was confined to North America. The four-wheel drive option available to SUVs reinforced the passive safety notion. In the case of 4WD, it does not improve braking. To support Gladwell's argument, he mentioned that automotive engineer David Champion noted that in his previous driving experience with Range Rover, his vehicle slid across a four-lane road because he did not perceive the slipping that others had experienced. Gladwell concluded that when a driver feels unsafe when driving a vehicle, it makes the vehicle safer. When a driver feels safe when driving, the vehicle becomes less safe. Gladwell's findings were published in The New Yorker which is not a scientifically accredited publication (Gladwell, 2004).

Stephen Popiel, a vice-president of Millward Brown Goldfarb automotive market-research company, noted that for most automotive consumers safety has to do with the notion that they are not in complete control. Gladwell argued that many of the 'accidents' are not outside driver's control, such as drunk driving, wearing seat belts, driver's age and experience, so a vehicle's safety also depends on the driver itself. Gladwell also noted learned helplessness plays a role in choosing an SUV.

Despite some evidence to the contrary, many SUV owners believe that they themselves and their passengers are much safer in an SUV than in a car.  However, some studies indicate that SUV occupants are not dramatically safer and may even be less safe than car occupants.  In 2004, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released results of a study that indicated that drivers of SUVs were 11% more likely to die in an accident than people in cars.  These figures may be compounded by variables other than the vehicles' inherent safety, for example the documented tendency for SUVs to be driven more recklessly (most sensationally perhaps, the 1996 finding that SUV drivers are more likely to drive drunk). SUV drivers are also less likely to wear their seatbelts. Actual driver death rates are monitored by the IIHS and vary between models.  These statistics do show average driver death rates in the US were lower in larger vehicles from 2002-2005, but there was significant overlap between vehicle categories. US Driver Death Rates from 2002-2005 in recent models (per million registered vehicles)

The IIHS report states, "Pound for pound across vehicle types, cars almost always have lower death rates than pickups or SUVs." It should be noted that these rates are per million registered vehicles and do not account for driver profiles and thus do not include such factors as age, gender, miles driven per year, and traffic conditions.  The NHTSA recorded occupant (driver or passenger) fatalities per 100M vehicle miles traveled at 1.16 in 2004 and 1.20 in 2003 for light trucks (SUVs, pick-ups and minivans) compared to 1.18 in 2004 and 1.21 in 2003 for passenger cars.  These numbers are very close despite the much larger average weight of light trucks..

Under criticism are the marketing techniques used to sell SUVs. Advertisers and manufacturers alike have been assailed for greenwashing. Critics have cited SUV commercials that show the product being driven through a wilderness area, even as most SUVs are never driven off-road. Even the model names have been criticized for connoting exotic wilderness areas (Chevrolet Tahoe, Dodge Durango, GMC Denali) and ruggedness (Ford Explorer, Chevrolet Blazer, Ford Expedition, Jeep Commander) that have little to do with the typical daily use of an SUV (i.e., transportation on paved roads); only the Chevrolet Suburban gets this right.

In the United States, Section 179 depreciation deduction, sometimes known as the 'SUV subsidy' allows small-business owners to deduct up to $25,000 of the cost of a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of over 6000 lb (2722 kg) from their income for income tax calculation. Small-business owners may deduct $10,610 of the cost of a passenger automobile. This provides a slight tax incentive for businesses to purchase an SUV. However, the cost of both SUVs and automobiles is fully deductible over future years using normal depreciation. In previous years, this deduction reached $120,000 and was the subject of much criticism. When the vehicle is eventually sold, however, the depreciation taken must be recaptured as income, subject to taxation.

The recent popularity of SUVs is generally thought of as one reason the U.S. population has begun to consume more gasoline than in previous years. SUVs are, as a class, much less fuel efficient than comparable passenger vehicles. The main reason is that SUVs are classified by the U.S. government as light trucks, and thus are subject to the less strict light truck standard under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations. The CAFE requirement for light trucks is an average of 20.7 mpg (US), versus 27.5 mpg (US) for passenger cars (11.4L/100km and 8.6L/100km, respectively).

By design SUVs have numerous fuel-inefficient features. Their high profile increases wind resistance and their mass requires heavier suspensions and larger engines, which both contribute to increased vehicle weight. Many SUVs come with tires designed for off-road traction rather than low rolling resistance.

The low fuel economy is caused by following relative to a passenger car:

Average data for vehicle types sold in the U.S.A:

 

Drag resistance for SUVs is at least (same drag coefficient) 30% higher and the acceleration force has to be 35% larger than family sedans if we use the figures from the above table. This gives a 40% higher fuel consumption (even for parallel hybrid electric SUVs) using the given formula for the power demand. 

Addressing fuel efficiency, several manufacturers now offer hybrid gas/electric models of SUVs, offering improved fuel economy over conventionally powered SUVs. With some hybrid SUV models, the added power generated from the hybrid systems is used some times to give vehicles added performance (increased power).  However, SUVs with hybrid engines still only experience gas mileage similar to that of gas powered family sedans, usually a smaller increase in fuel economy than sedans get when fitted with a hybrid engine.

Because SUVs typically use more fuel than cars, they generate higher volumes of pollutants (particularly carbon dioxide) into the atmosphere during their working lives. In the U.S., light trucks and SUVs are held to a less-strict pollution control standard than are passenger cars. In response to the trend that a growing share of fuel consumption and emissions are attributable to these vehicles, the Environmental Protection Agency ruled that by model year 2009, emissions from all light trucks and passenger cars will be regulated equally.

The British national newspaper The Independent reported on a study carried out by CNW Marketing Research which suggested that CO2 emissions alone do not reflect the true environmental costs of a car. The newspaper reported that: "CNW moves beyond the usual CO2 emissions figures and uses a "dust-to-dust" calculation of a car's environmental impact, from its creation to its ultimate destruction. The newspaper also reported that the CNW research put the Jeep Wrangler above the Toyota Prius and other hybrid cars as the greenest car that could be bought in the UK. The report also stated that Toyota disputed the proportion of energy used to make a car compared with how much the vehicle uses during its life - CNW said 80% of the energy a car uses is accounted for by manufacture and 20% in use - Toyota claimed the reverse. 

Top Gear Magazine also, in an article to find the "greenest car", placed the Land Rover Defender alongside the Honda Insight because of the claim that "75% of Defenders ever built are still on the road".

A study done by the Rocky Mountain Institute found that even after making assumptions that would lower the environmental impact of the Hummer H3 relative to the Prius; "the Prius still has a lower impact on the environment.  This indicates that the unpublished assumptions and inputs used by CNW must continue the trend of favoring the Hummer, or disfavoring the Prius. Since the researchersat Argonne Labs performed a careful survey of all recent life cycle analyses of cars, especiallyhybrids, our research underlines the deep divide between CNW’s study and all scientificallyreviewed and accepted work on the same topic." A report done by the Pacific Institute reveals "serious biases and flaws" with the study published by CNW, claiming that "the report’s conclusions rely on faulty methods of analysis, untenable assumptions, selective use and presentation of data, and a complete lack of peer review."

Concerns over the fuel consumption and subsequent increased pollution from SUVs have led various eco-sabotage groups, such as the Earth Liberation Front or Les Dégonflés to target SUV dealerships and privately-owned SUVs for ecotage.  Such acts can range from destruction (such as arson) to more passive attacks (such as deflating the vehicle's tires).

The high gross vehicle weight rating of some full-size SUVs (like the Ford Excursion and Hummer H2) technically limits their use on certain roads. These laws are rarely enforced for SUVs as they are classified as passenger vehicles instead of commercial trucks. Fortunately these small rural roads are a rare occurrence for most drivers. In addition many of these rural byways are giving way to more efficient and larger two lanes which support vehicles up to medium weight trucks.

The length and width of large SUVs have caused problems in urban areas. In areas with limited parking spaces, large SUVs have been highly criticized for parking in stalls marked for compact cars or that are too narrow for the width of certain larger SUVs. Critics have stated that this causes problems such as the loss of use of the adjacent space, reduced accessibility into the entry of an adjacent vehicle, blockage of driveway space, and damage inflicted by the door of the SUV to adjacent vehicles. As a backlash against the alleged space consumption of SUVs, cities across the world, such as London and Florence, have restricted access of SUVs to their city centers, and Paris and Vienna have debated banning them altogether. It is worth noting however that a first-generation Land Rover Discovery occupies a smaller area than a Volvo 740 estate/station wagon of the same era, and the Discovery II is shorter than a Ford Mondeo estate/station wagon of the same age.

In the United Kingdom where most road vehicles (except very low polluters) are subject to yearly road tax (VED) payments, the government is actively attempting to deter people from using SUVs using high taxation. The average family sized car would cost around £115 GBP ($226 USD) to tax yearly, wheras the average SUV may cost anything between £270 GBP ($532 USD) to £455 GBP ($896 USD) in road tax based on the CO2 mg/k emissions.

The business model of focusing on SUVs and light trucks is blamed for declining sales and profits among Detroit's Big Three automakers since the mid-late 2000s. 

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Big Three could enjoy profit margins of $10,000 per SUV, while losing a few hundred dollars on a compact car.  Consequently, these companies focused resources and design on SUVs over small cars (compact cars were sold mainly to attract young buyers with inexpensive options and to increase their fleet average fuel economies to meet federal standards). As a result of the shift in the Big Three's strategy, many long-running compact and midsize cars like the Ford Taurus, Buick Century, and Pontiac Grand Prix eventually fell behind their Japanese competition in features and image (relying more upon fleet sales instead of retail and/or heavy incentive discounts), some eventually being discontinued.   

With soaring gas prices in the mid-late 2000s, followed by a weakening economy, SUV and light truck sales have declined significantly.  The Big Three were unable to adapt as quickly as their Japanese rivals to produce small cars and crossovers to meet growing demand for fuel-efficient vehicles; the US offerings were also considered less competitive than their Japanese counterparts. This was due to inflexible manufacturing facilities, and the high wages of unionized workers in the United States and Canada (members of the UAW and CAW, respectively) compared to non-union workers such as that of Toyota, make it unprofitable to build small cars
