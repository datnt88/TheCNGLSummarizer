Flute repertory is the general term for pieces composed for flute (particularly Western concert flute) and often played by flutists (or flautists). The following lists are not intended to be complete, but rather to present a representative sampling of the most commonly played and well known works in the genre. The lists also do not generally include works originally written for other instruments and subsequently transcribed, adapted, or arranged for flute, unless such piece is very common in the repertory, in which case it is listed with its original instrumentation noted. 



Pieces with an "(O)" originally for flute and orchestra.  Title addenda such as "for flute and piano," and opus numbers omitted unless necessary for identification.

Many pieces for full or chamber orchestra include parts for one or more flutes.  These "orchestral excerpts" are popular requirements in musical auditions for flute positions, and are often assigned individually as part of flute studies.
