"Life" was the FYR Macedonia's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, performed in English (the first time the Macedonian entry had not featured at least some of the country's native language) by Toše Proeski.

Lyrically, the song is elliptical in meaning. Proeski sings about the need to make the most of life ("Life is a book and you gotta read it/Life is a story and you gotta tell it") and appears to be mourning the end of a relationship ("Roaming through my old emotions/I find new feelings of misery").

The song is more well-known for its unusual performance, which began with Proeski ostensibly alone on stage. As the opening bars of music were played, however, the arms of his backing dancers gradually engulfed him, eventually pulling him in various directions.

As FYR Macedonia had not competed in the 2003 Contest, the song was first performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed fifteenth (following Cyprus' Lisa Andreas with "" and preceding Slovenia's Platin with "Stay Forever"). At the close of voting, it had received 71 points, placing 10th in the 22-strong field and just qualifying FYR Macedonia for the final. In the final, it was performed fifteenth (following Russia's Yulia Savicheva with "Believe Me" and preceding Greece's Sakis Rouvas with "Shake It"). At the close of voting, it had received 47 points, placing 14th in a field of 24 and thus returning FYR Macedonia to the semi-final at their next Contest appearance.

It was succeeded as FYR Macedonian representative at the 2005 Contest by Martin Vučić with "".
