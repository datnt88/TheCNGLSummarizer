Col, he commanded an Infantry battalion at Okara  and then as a Brigadier, commanded two infantry brigades, one of which was at Kargil. He was awarded Sitara-i-Jurat for his extraordinary service and bravery by the then President Rafiq Tarar, after the Kargil encounter.

He commanded an Infantry Division on the LOC during the period of escalation, when Indian and Pakistani troops were tied up face to face in a very tense warlike state for two full years in 2001-03. He also served as GOC Jhelum. He then served as the Director General NAB (Punjab), and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General in 2005 and posted as Inspector General Training and Evaluation.

In July 2007, Lt. Gen Masood Aslam took charge of the sensitive post of Corps Commander Peshawar, replacing Lt Gen Hamid Khan. This was period when Pakistan Army launched military operation against the vigilantes of Lal Masjid in Islamabad that followed with a rising trend of terrorist attacks throughout Pakistan, mostly emanating from the rugged lands of Waziristan and the surrounding tribal regions. A counter-terrorist operation was then launched under the general which included 2007 Taliban Waziristan offensive, Battle of Mir Ali, and Battle of Swat.
