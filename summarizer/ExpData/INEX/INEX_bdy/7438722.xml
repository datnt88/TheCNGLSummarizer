For the Danish national final with the same name - see Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2007.

Melodi Grand Prix 2007 (shortened MGP 2007) was the television show in which the Norwegian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 was chosen.

Just like in 2006, there was be 3 semi finals held before the final, where televoting decided the Top 4 songs, the top 2 of who went to the final (in random order), and the songs who were placed 3rd and 4th go to the 'Second Chance' semi final (also in random order). If NRK follow their traditional ways, it is unlikely we will ever find out the full results of the semi finals.

On the 12th October 2006, NRK announced that it had received 464 songs for the 2007 Melodi Grand Prix, over half of which came from Sweden . However, in the final selection of the 18 participating entries, only five were written partially or entirely by Swedish composers, less than half the number of the 13 Swedish entries in Melodi Grand Prix 2006. This was most probably the results of the heavy criticism NRK received from Norwegian composers due to the heavy Swedish dominance in MGP 2006.

Just like in MGP 2006, Synnøve Svabø and Stian Barsnes Simonsen hosted all five shows. However, 2006's additional side commentator, Jostein Pedersen, has been swapped with trend guru and television host Per Sundnes, though Sundnes will play a slightly smaller role than his predecessor, primarily being in charge of interval reports from the different host cities. However, he will substitute Jostein Pedersen as the new Norwegian Eurovision commentator for NRK in Helsinki.
