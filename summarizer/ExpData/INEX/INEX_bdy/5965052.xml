Clone Bricks are imitation LEGO Bricks, such as Mega Bloks, Tyco bricks, and others. They are generally considered to be of lower quality and cheaper than LEGO brand bricks, though many will bind with LEGO bricks. The Lego Group has sought to put an end to clone bricks and retain sole manufacturing rights over the Lego Indicia. However, the Group's endeavors have mostly proved unsuccessful in court.

In 2002, the Lego Group's Swiss subsidiary Interlego AG sued the COKO company for copyright infringement. A trial court found many Coko bricks to be infringing; Coko was ordered to cease manufacture of the infringing bricks, publish a formal apology in the Beijing Daily, and pay a small fee in damages to Interlego. On appeal, the Beijing High People's Court upheld the trial court's ruling.
