Gemma Christina Arterton (born January 1986, in Gravesend, Kent) is an English actress. 

Arterton and her sister, Hannah Jane Arterton (born 1989, Gravesend), were raised by their father who was a welder, and mother who was a cleaner. After attending Gravesend Grammar School for Girls on Pelham Road in Gravesend attending a performance arts course, she trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art on a full grant.

Arterton was born with six fingers on each hand, as well as a crumpled ear, but had surgery as a child to correct the problems.

In 2007, Arterton lived with John Nolan, an animator who is employed in the film production industry in London. A year later in 2008, she broke up with Nolan. She is also rumoured to have dated Toby Kebbell and 19-year-old Spanish stuntman Eduardo Mu√±oz, her horse-riding instructor on the set of the Disney production, .

Arterton won her first professional role (in Stephen Poliakoff's Capturing Mary) while she was still at drama school. Similarly, she made her stage debut as Rosaline in Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost at the Globe Theatre, London in July 2007 before graduating later that year. She made her film debut in the 2007 St Trinian's movie St Trinian's as Head Girl Kelly, a role she gained in competition with Sienna Miller.

She also appeared in the 2008 comedy Three And Out with Mackenzie Crook and Imelda Staunton.

Arterton appears in a number of forthcoming film and television productions, including the next James Bond film, Quantum of Solace. Chosen from around 1500 candidates, Arterton will play a character called "Fields", in what is described as a "nice-sized role".

When it launches in October 2008 she will be the face of Avon's Bond Girl 007 fragrance. Having already started in a series of low-key adverts for cosmetics company Avon, in May 2008 Arterton requested a role opposite model Kate Moss for Rimmel, but was blocked on contractual terms under her Avon contract.
