The King of Chicago is a 1986 action adventure strategy computer game by Doug Sharp.  Based on numerous Hollywood mobster movies, this game is set in the 1930s.

The player starts in Chicago with a small mafia-type mob and follow Al Capone in being the mob-king of the city.  The goal of the game is to increase the size of one's gang in order to take over all mobster activity in the city.  The player must do this by a certain date in order to be included in the formation of the New York syndicate.

The game features many mobster activities, such as drive-by shootings, bombings, illegal gambling and bribing of corrupt government officials.  The player must murder and out-deal his opponents in order to win control of the city.  As if that weren't enough, the player also has to stay one step ahead of the law and keep his girlfriend satisfied by catering to her whims and desires, or risk losing her.

Like most early Cinemaware titles, this game featured polished graphics and innovative gameplay.

This game was first developed by Doug Sharp on the Mac, then limited to a monochrome display, using graphics based on digitized images of clay models. The game was then given a complete visual redesign by the inhouse Cinemaware art team for release on the Amiga, a powerful home computer of the era.  It was then ported to other systems.  It was eventually released for the Apple IIGS, Atari ST and DOS.  The Mac version was published by Mindscape and later versions for US platforms published by Cinemaware itself. Distribution in the UK, including platforms found almost exclusively there and in Europe, was done by Mirrorsoft.
