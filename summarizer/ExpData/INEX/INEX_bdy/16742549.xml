SAPICA (サピカ, Sapika) is a rechargeable contactless smart card ticketing system for public transport in Sapporo, Japan. The Sapporo IC Card Council (札幌ICカード協議会, Sapporo Aishī Kādo Kyōgikai) will introduce the system from January 2009. The council is composed of Sapporo City Transportation Bureau and the three bus companies, namely JR Hokkaidō Bus, Jōtetsu, and Hokkaidō Chūō Bus. The name of the card means "Sapporo's IC card". Sa'  (サッ, Sa' ) is also the sound (onomatopoeia) of quickly pulling a card out and pi'  (ピッ, pi' ) is the sound equivalent to "beep".

The integrated service with Kitaca, a smart card system to be introduced by JR Hokkaidō from autumn 2008, was once considered. However, the integration plan was canceled because of the cost.

From 2001 to 2004, Sapporo Municipal Subway experimented a different smart card called S.M.A.P. Card (S.M.A.P.カード, Sumappu Kādo).

Sapporo Municipal Subway will accept the card from January 2009. It is not yet announced when or whether the bus operators of the council will accept the card.
