Highway Encounter is a computer game released on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64 by Vortex Software in 1985. It was written by Costa Panayi who also coded Android, Android 2, TLL, Cyclone and Revolution.

Highway Encounter is a strategy/action game played from a 3D isometric perspective in which you must successfully chaperone a bomb along a long, straight stretch of highway and into the alien base at the end of it. There are thirty screens to pass through and most are filled with hazards that threaten to block your progress (such as barrels) or destroy you (aliens and explosive mines).

Players control a robotic "Vorton" (resembling a dalek from Doctor Who) and one of the things that provides Highway Encounter with its unique appeal is that the bomb is constantly being pushed onwards by your extra lives - four more Vortons, who accompany you along the highway. It is in fact possible for all your extra lives to be lost without the player character being destroyed once.

Highway Encounter was followed by a sequel, Alien Highway in 1986.
