Tenosynovitis is the inflammation of the fluid-filled sheath (called the synovium) that surrounds a tendon.  Symptoms of tenosynovitis include pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the particular joint where the inflammation occurs.   When the condition causes the finger to "stick" in a flexed position, this is called "stenosing" tenosynovitis, which is commonly called "Trigger Finger."

It usually occurs with tendinitis and it is related to stenosing tenosynovitis.

Possible treatments for tenosynovitis include cortisone injections (then a course of paracetamol and ibuprofen for pain) and an outpatient surgery to enlarge the synovium. The hand is splinted for a week or so.

Causes of tenosynovitis are unknown. Repeated use of hand tools can precede the condition, as well as arthritis or injury. Tenosynovitis  sometimes runs in families, and is generally seen more often in males than in females. The causes for children are even less known and have a recurrence rate of less than 1-5% after treatment.

 A physical examination shows swelling over the involved tendon. The health care provider may touch or stretch the tendon or have you move the muscle to which it is attached to see whether you experience pain.

Tenosynovitis brought the tennis career of Wimbledon champion Angela Buxton to an end at the age of 22.

Gonococcal Arthritis, though rare, can manifest itself as tenosynovitis
