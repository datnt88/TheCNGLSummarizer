The Portrait Series of currency notes is the fourth and current set of notes to be issued for circulation in Singapore. It was first introduced on 9 September 1999 by the Board of Commissioners of Currency Singapore (BCCS) whose role was since taken over by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) post-merger. 

This series features the portrait of Encik Yusof bin Ishak, the first president of Singapore. The design has been simplified, and a whole range of new security features were introduced. Polymer versions of this series have been released for general circulation by MAS since 4 May 2004. 

The Portrait Series was first released by the Board of Commissioners of Currency Singapore (BCCS) on 9 September 1999 to welcome the new millennium, designed by local artist Eng Siak Loy. The banknote's obverse features the portrait of the first president of Singapore, Encik Yusof bin Ishak. The reverse contain secondary themes that are linked to his life. The series has a total of seven denominations in general circulation; the denominations $1 and $500 were not carried forward from the previous Ship Series. 

A more standardized approach is adopted across all banknote denominations, with features noticeably differing from all previous series. The watermark no longer features a lion head, the national symbol for Singapore, replaced by the portrait of Yusof bin Ishak. Due to design considerations, the dollar sign was considered redundant and is no longer included in this series. The background on the obverse of the Portrait Series feature a different cowrie for each denomination. The colour for denominations up to $50 have been retained, a tradition kept since the era of the Malaya and British Borneo dollar. The note printing company no longer appears on any part of the portrait note.

Two significant changes were made to the circulation of the Portrait Series since its beginning. On 31 March 2003, the BCCS merged with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which took over the responsibility of banknote issuance. Banknotes after the date reflect the issuing authority as MAS and now bears the signature of the Chairman of MAS (currently SM Goh Chok Tong), replacing Dr. Richard Hu Tsu Tau. The second was the release of the polymer versions for general circulation, printed by Note Printing Australia, which first began on 4 May 2004. The paper version of the banknote remains in active circulation.

Previous security features in the Ship Series were carried over to the portrait series, and new ones incorporated into the banknote. Two prominent security features form the cornerstone of the banknote - the engraved portrait of Encik Yusof bin Ishak and the Kinegram; MAS states that banknotes with missing or mutilated portrait or/and Kinegram command no value. Paper versions issued by BCCS features its logo and the face value, which those issued by the MAS features its logo with the Merlion and the face value. Polymer versions of the banknote have the Kinegram replaced by an image of the Singapore lion symbol with the face value, showing the coat of arms of Singapore when tilted at varying degrees.

Other security features include lithographic print, anti-copying line structures, perfect registration, microprinting, asymmetrical serial number, windowed security thread and LiftTwin. Polymer versions of the banknote include two clear windows and other security features that substitute its paper version. Several features that are invisible to the naked eye appear when both versions of the banknote are exposed under UV light.
