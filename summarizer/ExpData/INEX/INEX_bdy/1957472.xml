Norma Jean &amp; Marilyn is a 1996 made-for-TV biographical film produced by Home Box Office and premiered on 18 May 1996. The film featured Ashley Judd as Norma Jean Dougherty and Mira Sorvino as Marilyn Monroe. It was partially-based on "Norma Jean: My Secret Life With Marilyn Monroe" by actor Ted Jordan (played by Josh Charles), who claimed to have had a years-long relationship with Monroe.

The tagline for the highly-fictionalized film summarizes the plot: "Marilyn Monroe was our fantasy. Norma Jean was her reality." In dream-like scenes, Monroe and her former self appear together, with Norma Jean sometimes taunting Marilyn. The original music score was composed by Christopher Young.

It was nominated for 5 Emmy Awards, including for both lead actresses.
