New Zealand's Misuse of Drugs Act is a national drug control law that classifies drugs into three classes, or Schedules, based on their risk of harm:

CANNABIS FRUIT. 

CANNABIS PLANT (whether fresh, dried, or otherwise)—That is, any part of any plant of the genus Cannabis except a part from which all the resin has been extracted. 

CANNABIS SEED. 

CATHA EDULIS PLANT. 

COCA LEAF—That is, the leaf of any plant of any species of the genus Erythroxylon, except a leaf from which all ecgonine, cocaine, and any other ecgonine alkaloids have been removed. 

Note 1: Pentobarbital, secobarbital, and amobarbital are subject to more legal restrictions and tougher penalties than other Class C substances. Note 2: Temazepam and flunitrazepam are subject to more legal restrictions and tougher penalties than other Class C substances.



The Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs (EACD) makes Scheduling decisions, based on scientific and medical evidence and/or international treaty obligations. New Zealand is a party to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. National Drug Policy New Zealand notes, "The Conventions place certain obligations on signatory countries.  When the UN classifies (or re-classifies) a substance under one of the above Conventions, it requires signatory countries to amend their domestic legislation to ensure consistency with the UN’s amendment. Accordingly, the impetus for some of the drugs to be considered by the EACD will originate from decisions made at the UN"http://www.ndp.govt.nz/drugs/legislation/moda-obligations.html.
