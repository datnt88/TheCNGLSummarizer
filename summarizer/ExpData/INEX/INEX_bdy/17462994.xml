Mobile donating refers to donating to an organization through a mobile device.  The primary means for mobile donating is through  SMS.  Mobile donating can also refer to consumers donating their old phones to a cause for recycling and reuse of the device.  

Mobile phone users can text to charities with mobile donating campaigns and have the donation tacked on to their cell phone bill, in increments ranging anywhere from $1 to $10 these are referred to as micro-donations.  Organizations use Short codes and a keyword to distinguish their charity across carriers.  

Example: Text ‘Alive’ to 90999  

Currently in the US non-profits can either foster a deal with each individual cell phone carrier or work with the Mobile Giving Foundation who acts as a gate keeper for the mobile carriers to certify NPO’s and keep mobile donating standards.  Currently only five companies have been approved as application providers by the Mobile Giving Foundation:Mobile Accord, Mobile Cause, Mobile Commons, Wireless Factory and Distributive Networks.  Distributive Networks is the mobile firm for the Obama for America campaign.

In the US there are only a handful of national mobile donating campaigns as of yet.   Mobile giving campaigns have run in the US during the Hurricane Katrina disaster, and the Indonesian tsunami.  Currently the  United Way , Keep a Child Alive and the ASPCA  are all running mobile donation campaigns through mGive and Mobile Accord.
