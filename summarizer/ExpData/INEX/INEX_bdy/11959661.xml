The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) was represented by Tose Proeski and the song "Life". The FYR Macedonian broadcaster decided to select the performer internally and to hold a competition to select the song. 

On February 14, the Macedonian national final took place at the Universal Hall in Skopje and hosted by Aneta Andonova &amp; Karolina Petkovska. Tose Proeski sang all the songs and the winner was chosen by televoting (1/3), an "expert" jury (1/3) and Tose himself (1/3) - "Angel si ti" was the favourite with all three. The song was written by Jovan Jovanov, who also participated in FYR Macedonian National Final in 2007 and came fourth.

Tose Proeski also participated in 2000 Macedonian National Final and 1998 as well. In 2000, Tose Proeski won the televote (with about 38,000 votes) and XXL were 2nd (with about 30,000 votes). In 1998 he came eighth.

At Eurovision, Tose created an ethno sound on the Istanbul stage. The performance contained elaborate choreography and dancers who wore very little clothing. Tose was dressed in white, while the backing vocals were dressed in black. The performance contained attention grabbing shots, which placed FYR Macedonia in the 14th position.
