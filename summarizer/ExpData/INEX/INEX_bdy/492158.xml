Home on the Range is the 44th animated feature produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures on April 2, 2004. The film is the forty-fifth animated feature in the Disney animated features canon, and was named after the popular country song "Home on the Range". It was the last movie in the canon to be released on VHS.

The film stars the voices of Roseanne Barr, Judi Dench, Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, G.W. Bailey, Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Randy Quaid.



A mismatched trio of dairy cows – brash, adventurous Maggie, prim, proper Mrs. Caloway and ditzy, happy-go-lucky  Grace (voiced by Roseanne Barr, Judi Dench and Jennifer Tilly respectively) – must capture an infamous cattle rustler, for his bounty, in order to save their idyllic farm from foreclosure. (As Grace puts it, "Who better to catch a cattle thief...than a cow?") Aiding them in their quest is Lucky Jack, a feisty, peg-legged rabbit, but a selfish horse named Buck (Cuba Gooding Jr.), eagerly working in the service of Rico, a famous bounty hunter, seeks the glory for himself.

Prior to the film's release, Disney stated that it would be their last film in their animated features canon to use traditional animation. Although Disney animated films have featured some computer-generated effects for many years, Disney announced plans to move entirely to CGI animation after Home on the Range, beginning with 2005's Chicken Little, and laid off most of its animation department. However, after the company's acquisition of Pixar in early 2006, new leaders John Lasseter and Ed Catmull decided to revive traditional animation, and announced the upcoming both 2D animation and 3D live-action film, The Princess and the Frog. Still, Home on the Range is the final feature in the canon to use the CAPS system which was first fully used in The Rescuers Down Under.

The film began pre-production after the release of Pocahontas in 1995. In August 2000, the film was announced as Sweating Bullets and scheduled for a fall 2003 release. The title was changed to Home on the Range in April, 2002.

This film was originally slated to have been released in November 2003, but story and production problems forced Disney to swap release dates with Brother Bear (originally slated for spring 2004) in December 2002. It was also expected to be given a G rating by the MPAA. However, sources inside Disney have indicated that a joke during the movie's opening sequence, one in which a cow's udder is subtly compared to surgically-enhanced breasts, resulted in the movie being slapped with a PG rating instead.  The studio also broke from its own tradition of releasing major films at either Thanksgiving or summer vacation (to maximize the family audience), releasing it on April 2nd.  There also was some speculation that Michael Eisner who had a made a controversial decision to end production of hand-drawn, 2-D animation chose this ill-timed release date to prove his contention that traditionally animated films were no longer viable.

Critics gave the film mixed reviews because they felt it was weak on plot . Rotten Tomatoes reported that 54% of critics gave positive reviews based on 111 reviews. According to Metacritic, the film's average rating was 50%, based on 30 reviews. Users gave the film a 4.2/10 approval rating based on 12 votes. However, the film was universally praised for Alan Menken's return to Disney animated features.

The film had a budget of about $110 million, making a U.S. box office gross of $50,026,353; but overall only grossed $103,951,461 worldwide, thus becoming a moderate box office failure.
