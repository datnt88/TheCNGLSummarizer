Ted Bloecher (born 1929) is an American ufologist. Researcher Jerome Clark described him as "highly regarded" for his scientific rigor, his detailed research, his efforts at balance and neutrality, and his reluctance to speculate beyond what is supported by given data. 

Born in Summit, New Jersey in 1929, Bloecher studied drama and music at Columbia University. He worked as a professional singer and actor until the early 1970s, including appearances in the Broadway productions of Hello, Dolly! and Oliver!. In the 1970s, Bloecher began a new career as a computer data processor. 

Bloecher became interested in UFOs during the wave of sightings across the U.S. in 1952. He cofounded Civilian Saucer Intelligence, which is regarded as an important, critically-minded UFO group. CSI was essentially moribund by 1959, and Bloecher then joined NICAP in May 1968 through July 1969. 

In 1967, NICAP published Bloecher's The UFO Wave of 1947, a detailed compilation of and reference guide to the hundreds of flying discs reported across the U.S. in 1947. Bloecher's other UFO publications of note include the "Humanoid Catalog" (co-written with David Webb) and Close Encounter at Kelly and Others 1955 (with Isabel Davis).

In the 1970s, Bloecher was associated with MUFON and CUFOS. In 1975, he co-investigated a series of UFO abduction reports with Budd Hopkins. 

In the early 1980s, Bloecher retired from ufology, donating his files to CUFOS.

He was also affiliated with the New York City Gay Men's Chorus.
