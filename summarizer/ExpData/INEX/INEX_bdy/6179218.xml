1:18 scale is a common reference to Diecast Replicas that are 1/18th the size of the real thing. Most popular in this category are 1:18 scale diecast automobile replicas.

Virtually all 1:18 scale models produced in recent years have functional steering wheels which turn the front wheels, along with doors, hoods, and trunks capable of opening and closing. Tires  are sometimes mounted on a workable suspension system. As a standard feature, the bonnet lifts to reveal a detailed and mechanically accurate engine bay. Most models are approximately 11 inches long by 5 inches wide by 4 inches tall. Such detail is many times unique to 1:18 scales and larger. Typically, companies that produce model cars will have licensing arrangements with real car manufacturers to make replicas of their cars, both in current production or of discontinued models. 

During the infancy of the 1:18 scale, Ertl and Revell were 2 of the few manufacturers selling a limited number of diecast models of cars, mostly older American models (although Revell Germany sold a number of diecast German and American models).  Ertl's 1:18 scale line was called "American Muscles" and throughout the 1990s, the number of different models increased exponentially.

By the mid-1990s, other manufacturers became aware of the money-making potential spurred on by the popularity of this scale, and introduced their own lines of models. These companies included Yat Ming, Sun Star, and Maisto. Often, cars featured in collectible car magazines (such as Collectible Automobile) were soon the subjects of 1:18 diecast models.  

During the early 2000s the quality and accuracy of models improved dramatically and these problems were largely solved. Today (2008), many features are now found in mainstream, low-priced diecasts that were only found in models costing upwards of $100.00. Engine wiring and plumbing, carpeting in the interior, detailed instrument panels, seatbelts, and photo-etched details are common even in models costing under $50.00.  Around 2005, "premium" manufacturers including Highway 61, GMP, AUTOart, and Lane Exact Detail began to offer very high-quality, highly-detailed models at higher prices. 

Today, the lower-priced models are easily obtainable from a number of diecast merchants, both online and in brick-and-mortar stores such as Toys R Us, Wal-Mart and KB Toys (in the United States). Premium models are typically offered on the Internet from various web sites, as well as numbers of online diecast stores. Sometimes, these stores offer the models at discounts from list price.
