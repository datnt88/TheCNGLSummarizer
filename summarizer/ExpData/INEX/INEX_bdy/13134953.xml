Zajdi, zajdi, jasno sonce (O Set, O Set, Clear Sun; Macedonian: Зајди, зајди, јасно сонце; Bulgarian: Зайди, зайди, ясно слънце) is a popular Macedonian and  Bulgarian song which has in recent times gained popularity throughout the Balkans. In the past sixty years, it has become one of the songs the people of the most often associate with Macedonia.

The song is based on the text of a folk song collected by the Bulgarian writer Lyuben Karavelov in Veliko Turnovo in 1878. More than half of century later the Macedonian singer-songwriter Aleksandar Sarievski changed a small part of the text but preserved the original arrangement. 

The origin of the song is a matter of dispute between parties in Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia. According to folklorist Nikolai Kaufman, who finds the melody identical to that of an earlier Karavelov song, it is based on a Bulgarian folk song. Professor Georgi Kraev, on the other hand, views it as more of Balkan song, originally popularised in Bulgaria and only later in the rest of the peninsula. The text itself is derived from two different songs initially published by Karavelov in 1878 or even in 1861.
