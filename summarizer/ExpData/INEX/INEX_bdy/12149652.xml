Teresa "Tracy" Bond (born Teresa "Tracy" Draco, and also known as the Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo) is a fictional character in the James Bond film and novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service (OHMSS). To date she is the first cinematic Bond girl to officially marry secret agent Commander James Bond, though Bond would later marry again (though the second marriage was invalid) in John Gardner's Scorpius. In the film version of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Tracy was played by actress Diana Rigg.

Born Teresa Draco in 1943, she is the child of Marc-Ange Draco, the head of "The Union Corse", a powerful international Mafia crime syndicate â€“ not quite as large as SPECTRE, but with substantially larger "legal" operations, including Draco Construction. Teresa goes by "Tracy" because she feels "Teresa" is too grand.  (As she once said, "Teresa is a saint; I'm known as Tracy.")  

Teresa was the only daughter of Marc-Ange Draco and his English-born wife, who had met him while he was hiding out from the authorities in Corsica.  Tracy's mother died when she was only 12; her father then sent her to a boarding school in Switzerland.  Deprived of a stable home life, Tracy joined the "international fast set", committing "one scandal after another"; when Draco cut off her allowance, Tracy committed "a greater folly" out of spite.  She later married Italian Count Giulio di Vicenzo who, during their marriage, got hold of a large portion of her money before eventually leaving her; he subsequently died while driving a Maserati in the company of one of his mistresses.  During this marriage, Tracy had a child, who later died of spinal meningitis. 

Desperate with grief for her child, Tracy attempted suicide by jumping into the sea, to be saved by James Bond. Her father pleaded with Bond to continue to see her, claiming that their relationship had changed her for the better. Bond initially refused, but he changed his mind when Marc-Ange offered his resources for anything Bond desired. Since the events of Thunderball and the demise of SPECTRE, Bond had been hunting for Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and at one point was willing to retire from MI6 because he felt the hunt was folly and that his services and abilities could be used better. Using Draco's resources, however, Bond was able to track Blofeld to Switzerland. In return, Bond continued to see Tracy and eventually fell in love with her. They married, but Tracy was murdered on their wedding day in a drive-by shooting.

In the novel, Blofeld fires an automatic weapon from his car killing Tracy, who is at the wheel of her Lancia Aurelia, with Bond in the passenger seat. In the film, Bond and Tracy leave their wedding in his Aston Martin DBS and stop to remove flowers from the car. A Mercedes 600 drives past with Blofeld at the wheel, and Irma Bunt in the back. She fires the gun which kills Tracy, who is shot through the Aston Martin's windscreen. She was the first and so far, only, Bond girl  to ever marry James Bond (Kissy Suzuki and Anya Amasova have otherwise posed as his wives), as well as being one of the few Bond girls with whom it was strongly suggested that Bond was actually in love.

The follow up film, Diamonds Are Forever, has James Bond tracking Blofeld in the pre-title credits sequence, but it is only assumed Bond is doing so to avenge Tracy's murder, as she is never mentioned. Originally, it had been planned that On Her Majesty's Secret Service would end with Bond and Tracy driving away from their wedding. The scenes where she was shot were filmed at the same time with the intention that they would form the pre-title sequence of Diamonds Are Forever. However, when George Lazenby declined to return as Bond, this was rendered unviable, as it would have meant either having two actors play Bond in Diamonds Are Forever or re-filming Tracy's death scene with the new actor as Bond, so the scenes were added to the end of On Her Majesty's Secret Service.

Subsequent films refer the fact that Bond was previously married, but only rarely:
