Servbot (Kobun in Japan, which roughly means "little follower") are a series of characters from the Mega Man Legends'' series.  They are not a single character but one of a group of 41 small, indestructible robots made by the air pirate Tron Bonne to do her bidding.  Each Servbot has its own ability from cooking to cleaning to battle, and they do various chores on board the Bonne family airship the Gesellschaft. They first appear in Mega Man Legends as an enemy of sorts which Tron sends to rob banks and cause a general commotion. However, by Mega Man Legends 2, the Servbots begin to treat Mega Man more kindly (though still antagonistically), thanks in part to their mother's crush on Mega Man. They behave like children and love and adore Tron like a mother, however strict she may be with them. Despite their small size, they can be quite powerful fighters and are vital to the Bonnes success as pirates.  Servbots also love to eat spaghetti, curry, and drink coffee.

Servbots are similar in appearance to little Lego figures and are often referred to as "Lego People" for that reason.  They also serve as the comic relief throughout the Legends series. During their adventures in The Misadventures of Tron Bonne'', the Servbots don't seem to realize (or perhaps care) that they're stealing or doing anything wrong.  Rather, they probably see their missions as just playing or simply doing anything they can to make Tron happy.  They are unconditionally loyal and will gladly do anything for Tron, in contrast to the disloyal and double dealing Birdbots.
