Ashmead's Kernel is a diploid cultivar of apple.

Ashmead's Kernel is reported as having been raised by Dr Ashmead in Gloucester, England in the 1700's.

This desert apple is of medium size, between 65:70mm diameter and has a flat round shape.  The base colour of the apple is greenish yellow, yet has a dull russet colour all over; sometimes there are brownish red stripes. Ashmead's Kernel makes a good apple juice because of its sweet sharp flavour. 

Produces an upright spreading tree, that generally crops well, though on exposed sites it can be irregular. It is a cultivar that is susceptible to bitter pit. The fruit is generally picked in October for use between December and February.
