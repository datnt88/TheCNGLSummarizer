SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 6, also known as SOX6, is a human gene. 

The SOX gene family encodes a group of transcription factors defined by the conserved high mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain. Unlike most transcription factors, SOX transcription factors bind to the minor groove of DNA, causing a 70- to 85-degree bend and introducing local conformational changes.[supplied by OMIM]
