For Carbon-14 discoverer, see Sam Ruben.

Samuel Ruben (14 July, 1900 - 16 July, 1988) was an inventor who made lasting contributions to electrochemistry and solid-state technology, including the founding of Duracell.

Samuel Ruben got his start in electronics when he became a licensed ham radio operator and built radios with spare parts. Samuel Ruben met Professor Bergen Davis of Columbia University who tutored him and allowed him to sit in on some Columbia classes. 

While he had no college degree, leaving withdrawing from college after a short time due to stress, Ruben received several honorary degrees. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Columbia University in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Science where he was a Senior Staff Associate.

Samuel Ruben established Ruben Laboratories in the early 1920s, and accumulated over 300 patents. Ruben teamed with Phillip Rogers Mallory to create what would become Duracell International. Ruben developed the mercury button cell in 1942 to replace the zinc-carbon batteries.

With over 100 inventions credited to him personally, one of the most important was the dry electrolytic aluminum capacitor, the solid-state magnesium/cupric sulfide rectifier, and the vacuum tube relay, the quick heater vacuum tube, and the concept of a balanced-cell mercury battery.

Ruben worked as a researcher from 1918-1921 for the Electrochemical Products Company. 

Samuel Ruben published multiple books, including a unique way to display the elements, titled Handbook of the Elements, and an autobiography entitled Necessity's Children: Memoirs of an Independent Inventor.
