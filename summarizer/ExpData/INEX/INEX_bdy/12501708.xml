nimoca (ニモカ, Nimoka) is a rechargeable contactless smart card ticketing system for public transport in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. Nishi-Nippon Railroad (Nishitetsu) introduced the system from May 18, 2008. Its name is an acronym of "nice money card", while nimo (にも, nimo) in Japanese means "also", as the card will be usable on buses, also on trains, also on shopping, etc. Like other electronic fare collection systems in Japan, the card uses RFID technology developed by Sony corporation known as FeliCa. The card features a ferret as an official mascot.

As of May 2008

Future plans

These three cards can be issued either as prepaid cards or commuters passes.

In future, there will be two other systems in Fukuoka, SUGOCA by Kyūshū Railway Company (JR Kyūshū) and Hayakaken by Fukuoka City Transportation Bureau, both to be introduced from spring 2009. The three cards in Fukuoka and Suica, a card already used in Greater Tokyo Area by East Japan Railway Company (JR East), will have integrated services from spring 2010.
