SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 13, also known as SOX13, is a human gene.

This gene encodes a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of cell fate. The encoded protein may act as a transcriptional regulator after forming a protein complex with other proteins. It has also been determined to be a type-1 diabetes autoantigen, also known as islet cell antibody 12.
