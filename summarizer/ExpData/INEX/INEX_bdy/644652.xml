"Headlines" is a segment on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno airing weekly. The segment usually airs on Monday, though at times it airs on Tuesday. It was first seen in 1987, when Jay Leno was still a guest host. Viewers submit funny newspaper headlines from all over the world. 











 



















Since the early 1980s, David Letterman has been doing a similar segment called "Small Town News" (albeit on and off) on Late Night and The Late Show. Conan O'Brien parodies Headlines on Late Night in a segment called Actual Items, which uses advertisements purposefully doctored by the show's prop and writing staffs.

Leno released several compilations of Headlines during the late 1980s and early 1990s:

Wil B. Strange includes "personal ads from the book 'Jay Leno's Headlines'" in an issue of Campus Life.
