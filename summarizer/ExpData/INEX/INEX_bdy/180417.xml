The Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery is located at 1218 Glendon Avenue in the Westwood Village area of Los Angeles, California.

It is the resting place of some of the entertainment industry's greatest names, although it was not always sought-after.  That changed over the years, however, and now Westwood Village has become on par with Forest Lawn as the ultimate Hollywood hereafter "hot spot".  Indeed, when it was announced Marilyn Monroe was to be buried there in 1962, observers were astonished.  Joe DiMaggio, responsible for the funeral arrangements, chose Westwood for its obscurity.  However Marilyn Monroe's burial turned it into one of the prime cemeteries in Los Angeles.
