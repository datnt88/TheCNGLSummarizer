The Macintosh is the original Apple Macintosh personal computer.  Its beige case contains a 9-inch monitor and comes with a keyboard and mouse, an indentation in the top of the case allows the computer to be lifted and carried, and it had a selling price of $2,495 USD.  The Macintosh was introduced by the now famous $1.5 million USD  television commercial by Ridley Scott, "1984" that most notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on 22 January, 1984 .  The sales of the Macintosh were strong from its initial release and reached 72,000 on May 3, 1984; afterwards sales plummeted.  After its successor was introduced, it was rebadged as the Macintosh 128K to differentiate it. 

The Macintosh was designed to achieve adequate graphics performance, which had previously required hardware over $10,000 USD, at a price accessible to the middle class. This narrow goal resulted in an elegant, efficient design which traded off expandability but met or exceeded the baseline performance of its competitors.

The centerpiece of the machine is an 8 MHz Motorola 68000 connected to a 128 KB DRAM by a 16-bit data bus. Lack of RAM proved to be a fatal constraint to much multimedia software, and although this baseline was similar to its competitors it could not be upgraded. A 64 KB ROM chip boosts the effective memory to 192 KB, but this is offset by the display's 22 KB framebuffer, which is shared with the DMA video controller. 

The built-in display is a very sharp one-bit black-and-white, 9-inch CRT with a resolution of 512x342 pixels, establishing the desktop publishing standard of 72 PPI. Expansion and networking are achieved using two standard RS-422 DE-9 serial ports named "printer" and "modem", albeit they did not support hardware handshaking. An Apple floppy drive could be added using a proprietary connector. The keyboard and mouse use simple proprietary protocols, allowing some third-party upgrades.  The keyboard has no arrow keys or numeric keypad — although later, a numeric keypad could be purchased separately. As with the Apple II and the Apple Lisa before it, the mouse has only a single button. Standard headphones can also be connected to a monaural jack. Apple also offered their 300 &amp; 1200 bit/s modems originally released for the Apple II line. Initially the only printer available was the Apple ImageWriter. Eventually, the LaserWriter and other printers were capable of being connected using AppleTalk, Apple's built-in networking system.

	The Macintosh contains a 400 kB, single-sided 3.5 inch floppy disk drive and dedicates no space to other internal mechanical storage. The Mac OS was disk based from the beginning, as RAM had to be conserved, but this "Startup Disk" can still be temporarily ejected. (Ejecting the root filesystem remained an unusual feature of the Classic Mac OS until it was retired.) One floppy disk could be sufficient to store the System Software, an application, and the data files created with the application. Indeed, the 400 kB drive capacity is larger than the PC XT's 360 kB 5.25 inch drive. However, more sophisticated work environments of the time required separate disks for documents and the system installation. The Macintosh External Disk Drive (mechanically identical to the internal one, piggybacking on the same controller) was a popular add-on at $495. Third party Hard drives were considerably more expensive and connected to the slower serial port (as specified by Apple), though a few manufacturers chose to use the faster non-standard floppy port. The 128K can only use the original Macintosh File System for storage. 

The unit does not include a fan; this made it quiet while in operation. Steve Jobs insisted that the Macintosh ship without a fan, a marketing (not engineering) decision that persisted until the introduction of the Macintosh SE in 1987, after Jobs was forced out of Apple. This was the source of many common — and very expensive — component failures in the first four Macintosh models, so much so that Larry Pina wrote two very successful (and now highly sought-after) how-to repair manuals, The Dead Mac Scrolls and Macintosh Repair &amp; Upgrade Secrets. The persistent overheating, and the design of the floppy disk drive, led to the nickname "The beige toaster".

The Macintosh shipped with the very first System and Finder application, known to the public as "System 1.0" (actually version 0.97 in the original release, followed by 1.1). The original Macintosh saw three upgrades to both before it was discontinued. Apple recommends System 2.0 &amp; Finder 4.2, with System 3.2 &amp; Finder 5.3 as the maximum. System 4.0 officially dropped support for the Macintosh 128K as evidenced by its distribution on 800K floppy disks, which the 128K could not use.

The applications MacPaint and MacWrite were bundled with the Mac. Other programs available included MacProject, MacTerminal and Microsoft's Word. The Macintosh also came with a manual and a unique guided tour cassette tape which worked together with the guided tour diskette as a tutorial for both the Macintosh itself and the bundled applications, since almost no one had ever used a mouse before, much less manipulated a graphical user interface. 

Released in 1984 as simply the Apple Macintosh, following the release of the Macintosh 512K which expanded the memory from 128 KB to 512 KB, the original Macintosh was re-branded Macintosh 128K and nicknamed the 'thin Mac', and the new 512K model the 'fat Mac'. While functionally the same, as closed systems, the Macintosh and Macintosh 128K were technically two different computers, with the re-badged 128K containing a completely redesigned logicboard to easily accommodate both 128K and 512K RAM configurations during manufacture. Though the RAM was still permanently soldered to the logicboard, the new design allowed for easier, though unsanctioned, third party upgrades to 512K than the previous model had. In addition, most of the newer models contained the 1984 revision B of the ROM to accommodate changes in the 400K floppy disk drive.

The increased RAM was vitally important for the Macintosh as it finally allowed for powerful software applications such as the popular program Microsoft Multiplan (eventually renamed Microsoft Excel.) However, Apple continued to market the 128K for over a year as an entry level computer, to the mid-level 512K and high end Lisa (, and claiming it could be easily expanded should the user ever need more RAM.

The Macintosh 128K was severely limited by a lack of upgrades. With cost as the dominant driving force behind its engineering, there was no provision for an upgrade card. Improving on the hard-wired RAM thus required a motherboard replacement (which unfortunately was priced similarly to a new computer), or a third party chip replacement upgrade, which was not only expensive but would void Apple's warranty. The difficulty of fitting software into its free memory discouraged software vendors from supporting it, leaving the 128K with a relatively small software library. Whereas the Macintosh Plus, and to a lesser extent the Macintosh 512K, are compatible with much later software, the 128K is limited to specially crafted programs. In fact due to the lack of memory, Apple intentionally chose to exclude the 128K from three of its most important early developments, effectively orphaning it from the rest of the Macintosh family: The Hard Disk 20 (Apple's first hard drive for the Macintosh), 800K floppy disk drive and  AppleShare (Apple's built-in networking file sharing technology), all of which required the Hierarchical File System introduced in September 1985, which the 128K could not use with its limited RAM. This made it more of an appliance than the rest of the Macintosh series, to the chagrin of many customers who expected a well-rounded entry-level computer. As a result, the 128K generally "felt" like a hybrid between its 8-bit ancestors and more capable successors.

Apple did provide an expensive "official" upgrade path for the Macintosh 128K, which included a motherboard replacement effectively making it a Macintosh 512K. Additionally, Apple offered an 800K floppy disk drive kit, including updated 128K ROMs, which required the 512K logic board upgrade, resulting in a Macintosh 512Ke. Finally, the upgraded 128K-to-512Ke could be upgraded to a Macintosh Plus by swapping the logicboard as well as the case back (to accommodate the slightly different port configuration) and optionally adding the Macintosh Plus extended keyboard. Any of the kits could be purchased alone or together at anytime, to upgrade the Macintosh 128K piecemeal or all-at-once. All upgrades were required to be performed by professional Apple technicians.
