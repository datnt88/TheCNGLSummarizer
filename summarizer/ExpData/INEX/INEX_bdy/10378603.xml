Bond Girls Are Forever is a 2002 James Bond documentary film hosted by actress Maryam d'Abo, who had played the role of Kara Milovy in the 15th James Bond film The Living Daylights. It was accompanied by a 2003 book written by John Cork and d'Abo. The book is subtitled The Women of James Bond. Both the film and the book is a tribute to the elite club of women who have played the role of a Bond Girl. 

The TV film, which was released in November 2002 alongside Die Another Day features interviews with a number of Bond girls who were featured throughout the film franchise between the first James Bond film, Dr. No (1962) starring Ursula Andress and the then current 20th film Die Another Day starring Halle Berry. In 2003, the documentary was released on DVD and offered as a free gift with the purchase of Die Another Day on DVD by some retailers.

In 2006, a new version of the documentary, updated to include interviews with cast from Casino Royale and edited to include commercial breaks, was produced for the AMC network and was later released as a bonus feature on the March 2007 DVD release of Casino Royale.

Emmy award-winning singer Faith Rivera performed a rendition of "Nobody Does it Better" over the closing credits of the DVD documentary.
