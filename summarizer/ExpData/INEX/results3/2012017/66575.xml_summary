A nutrient is food or chemicals that an organism needs to live and grow or a substance used in an organism's metabolism which must be taken in from its environment.
Methods for nutrient intake vary, with animals and protists having an internal digestive system, but plants externally digesting nutrients before ingesting them.
A nutrient is essential to an organism if it cannot be synthesized by the organism in sufficient quantities and must be obtained from an external source.
