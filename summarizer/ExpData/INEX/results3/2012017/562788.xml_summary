This suggests that anaerobic exercise may be more effective in raising the resting metabolic rate (Basal Metabolic Rate).
Heart rate is important for basal metabolic rate and resting metabolic rate because it drives the blood supply, stimulating the Krebs cycle.
This in turn leads to a lower resting heart rate, lower blood pressure, and increased resting or basal metabolic rate.
