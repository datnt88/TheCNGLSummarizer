The Atwater system (after Wilbur Olin Atwater) or derivatives of this system are used for the calculation of the available energy of foods.
where Dp, Df, and Dcho are respectively the digestibility coefficients of protein, fat and carbohydrate calculated as
These vary slightly depending on sources and Atwater derived weighted values for the gross heat of combustion of the protein, fat and carbohydrate in the typical mixed diet of his time.
