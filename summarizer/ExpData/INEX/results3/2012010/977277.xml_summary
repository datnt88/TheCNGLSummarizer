In Argentina, the Licentiate degree (Castilian: Licenciatura) is a 4-5 year degree (6 years in some cases under the accomplishment of the licentia doctorandi thesis dissertation), generally equivalent to an M.Sc. or M.A. in North American universities.
In the Portuguese higher education system, the licentiate's degree (Licenciatura) is the first degree awarded by institutions of higher education.
After the Bologna Process, the Licenciatura became an undergraduate academic degree awarded to students by higher education institutions after a 3 or 4 year 1st cycle of study at a university, polytechnical institute or other higher education institution.
