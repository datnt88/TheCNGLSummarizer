Otago Harbour is the natural harbour of Dunedin, New Zealand, consisting of a long, much-indented stretch of generally navigable water separating Otago Peninsula from the mainland.
A significant area at the head of the harbour has been reclaimed since the founding of Dunedin, primarily for industrial use.
This is the first, explicit and identifiable reference to a European ship in the Otago Harbour.
