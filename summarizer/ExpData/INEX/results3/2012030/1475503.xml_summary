Testis-determining factor (TDF) is a general term for the gene (or product thereof) that results in maleness in humans and some other species.
Embryos are gonadally identical, regardless of genetic sex, until a certain point in development; then the testis-determining factor causes male sex organs to develop, while lack of this factor will cause the embryo to develop as physically female.
It is a DNA binding protein, that enhances other transmission factors, or is a transcription factor itself.
