In Britain a unit of alcohol is defined as 10 millilitres (or approximately 8 grams) of ethanol (ethyl alcohol).
The number of units of alcohol in a drink can be determined by multiplying the volume of the drink (in millilitres) by its percentage ABV, and dividing by 1000 (or litres &amp;times; % abv).
It is often misleadingly stated that a unit is supplied by a small glass of wine,  half a pint of beer, or a single measure of spirits.
