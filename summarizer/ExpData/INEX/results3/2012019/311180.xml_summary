Prout's hypothesis was an early 19th century attempt to explain the existence of the various chemical elements through a hypothesis regarding the internal structure of the atom.
He then hypothesized that the hydrogen atom was the only truly fundamental object, and that the atoms of other elements were actually groupings of various numbers of hydrogen atoms.
This resulted in hypothesis that one-quarter of a hydrogen atom was the common unit.
