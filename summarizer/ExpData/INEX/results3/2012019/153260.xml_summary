Friedrich Ernst Dorn (27 July 1848 â€“ 16 December 1916) was a German physicist who was the first to discover that a radioactive substance, later named radon, is emitted from radium.
In 1900, Dorn published a paper in which he described experiments that repeated and extended some earlier work on thorium by Ernest Rutherford.
Dorn verified Rutherford's observation that a radioactive material was emitted by thorium, and discovered that a similar emission arose from the element radium.
