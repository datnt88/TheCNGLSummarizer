The DataHand keyboard was introduced in 1995 by DataHand Systems, Inc.  Before that it was produced by Industrial Innovations as early as 1992.
This allows you to place each hand wherever it is most comfortable to you.
Due to supplier issues, DataHand Systems, Inc. has recently announced on its web site that it will not sell the DataHand keyboard "until a new manufacturer can be identified."
