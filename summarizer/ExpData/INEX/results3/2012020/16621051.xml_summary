The NT$2,000 was initially the only banknote to feature a holographic strip, being the highest denomination banknote in public circulation.
The NT$200 banknote was first issued on 2 January 2002 for general circulation.
First introduced in 15 December 2000 for general circulation, the Central Bank of China relaunched the banknote with holographic strip and a darker colour due to counterfeiting concerns and possible confusion with the NT$100 banknote.
