The Portrait Series of currency notes is the fourth and current set of notes to be issued for circulation in Singapore.
Previous security features in the Ship Series were carried over to the portrait series, and new ones incorporated into the banknote.
The obverse of the Singaporean version is similar to the current Portrait Series, whereas the obverse of the Brunei version is similar to the $50 and $100 of the 2004 series.
