Although she was venerated soon after her death, Agnes was not beatified and canonized until relatively recently.
Agnes was engaged to Hedwig and Heinrich's son Boleslav.
She decided to devote her life to religious works, with the help of Pope Gregory IX. She became a member of the Franciscan Poor Clares, a religious order founded by Clare of Assisi (with whom she corresponded for over two decades but never met in person).
