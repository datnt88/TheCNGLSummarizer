The United States twenty-dollar bill ($20) is a denomination of United States currency.
The twenty-dollar bill is the primary banknote (and in most cases, the only banknote, as it would increase costs to make ATMs compatible with other bills) dispensed by ATMs in the United States as well as the primary bill used for withdrawals or cashing checks.
Jackson first appeared on the twenty dollar bill in 1928.
