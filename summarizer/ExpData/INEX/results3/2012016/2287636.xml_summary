The name of the beautiful Sleeping Beauty is "Princess Aurora" (Latin for "dawn"), in this film, as it was in the original Tchaikovsky ballet; this name occurred in Perrault's version, not as the princess's name, but as her daughter's.
A 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition release of Sleeping Beauty, as a 2-disc DVD &amp; Blu-ray Disc, was released on October 7, 2008, making Sleeping Beauty the first entry in the Platinum Edition line to be released in high definition video.
Various characters from the film also appear in the board game of the same name.
