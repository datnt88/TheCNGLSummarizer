Benzene in soft drinks is the occurrence of the carcinogenic (cancer-causing) chemical benzene in certain soft drinks.
Taking the worst example found to date, of a soft drink containing 87.9 ppb benzene, someone drinking a 500 ml can would ingest 44 μg (micrograms) of benzene.
While there is no justification for a soft drink to contain high levels of benzene ("There is a difference here between a small and unavoidable risk, and a small but avoidable risk.”), the casual consumption of such a drink is unlikely to pose a significant health hazard to a particular individual (see, for example, the EPA IRIS document on benzene).
