For the Dance Contest, see Eurovision Dance Contest 2009.
The Eurovision Song Contest 2009 will be the 54th Eurovision Song Contest, scheduled to take place between the 12 May and 16 May 2009.
Telewizja Polska (TVP), the Polish broadcaster, suggested that an international jury similar to the one used in the 2008 Eurovision Dance Contest be introduced in the Eurovision Song Contest to lessen the impact of neighbourly voting and place more emphasis on the artistic value of the song.
