Dating to the first quarter of the first century AD, it originally stood in a temple in the Gallo-Roman civitas of Lutetia (modern Paris, France) and is one of the earliest pieces of representational Gaulish art to carry a written inscription (Hatt, 1952).
The pillar was erected outside one of these temples.
The Christian cathedral of St. Etienne  was founded by Childebert in 528 on the site of the Gallo-Roman temple; Notre-Dame de Paris was in turn built over this in 1163.
