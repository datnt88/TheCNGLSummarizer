In Ancient Roman architecture a cryptoporticus (from Latin crypta and porticus) is a covered corridor or passageway.
The cryptoporticus of Reims, formerly enclosing three sides of the forum, is of Gallo-Roman origin and was probably built during the 3rd century.
Today, only its Eastern part remains, but this is unusually well preserved for a Gallo-Roman structure.
