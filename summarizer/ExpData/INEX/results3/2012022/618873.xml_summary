The term Gallo-Roman describes the Romanized culture of Gaul under the rule of the Roman Empire.
Gallo-Roman language persisted in the northeast into the Silva Carbonaria that formed an effective cultural barrier with the Franks to the north and east, and in the northwest to the lower valley of the Loire, where Gallo-Roman culture interfaced with Frankish culture in a city like Tours and in the person of that Gallo-Roman bishop confronted with Merovingian royals, Gregory of Tours.
Lyon, the capital of Roman Gaul, is now the site of a Museum of Gallo-Roman Civilization (rue CÃ©berg), associated with the remains of the theater and odeon of Roman Lugdunum.
