For Gaul before the Roman conquest, see Gaul.Roman Gaul consisted of an area of provincial rule in the Roman Empire, in modern day France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and western Germany.
Current historical research believes that Roman Gaul was "Roman" only in certain (albeit major) social contexts (the importance of which hindered a better historical understanding of the permanence of many Celtic elements).
The Gallo-Roman, or Vulgar Latin, dialect of the late Roman period evolved into the dialects of the OÃ¯l languages and Old French in the north, and Occitan in the south.
