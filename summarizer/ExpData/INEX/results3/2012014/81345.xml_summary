Although Luigi is a plumber, as his brother, other facets of his personality vary from game to game.
Another Nintendo source in the form of Super Smash Bros. Brawl has a trophy of Luigi that states Luigi to be, "Mario's younger twin brother." However, Solid Snake's Codec conversation, as well as the Paper Luigi trophy, both state that Luigi is the younger brother, with Colonel Roy Campbell even calling Luigi a "kid brother." Despite the contradictory sources, Mario acts like a traditional older brother towards Luigi.
Since Super Mario Bros., Luigi and Mario have made extensive use of items to extend their abilities, such as the Super Mushroom, which allows the player's character to grow larger, the Fire Flower, which allows him to become Fire Luigi and throw fireballs until damaged (in recent games, Luigi launches green fireballs), and the Starman, which grants Mario or Luigi temporary invulnerability.
