Information about Super Mario 64 first leaked out in November 1995, and a playable version of the game was presented days later as part of the world premiere for the Nintendo 64 (then known as the "Ultra 64") at Nintendo Space World.
Super Mario 64 has been critically acclaimed.
Rumor has it that elements from Super Mario 64 2 were eventually transferred over to Super Mario Sunshine and New Super Mario Bros.
