For the software program Virtual Human, see Virtual Woman.
In 1997, Industrial Light and Magic worked on creating a virtual actor that was a composite of the bodily parts of several real actors.
The use of a digital clone in the performance of the cloned person's primary profession is an economic difficulty, as it may cause the actor to act in fewer roles, or be at a disadvantage in contract negotiations, since the clone could be used by the producers of the movie to substitute for the actor in the role.
