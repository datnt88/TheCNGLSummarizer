An example of a boy racer car of the old generation is the Ford Escort (both the early rear wheel drive versions such as the RS2000 and the later XR3i variants) due to their low cost and easily tuned engine, while modern boy racers generally use hot hatchbacks such as the Renault Clio and the Nova SR.
There is often no distinction in the mainstream media between the boy racer and modified car enthusiast which can lead to the latter being tarred with the same brush.
Most 'boy racers' do not associate themselves with the term, and instead think of themselves as car enthusiasts.
