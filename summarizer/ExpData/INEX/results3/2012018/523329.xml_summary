1967 was the final year that Corgi issued Monte Carlo Rally cars, and the famous Mini Cooper S (339) appeared yet again in March, this time with four jewelled rally lamps in the grill, a sump guard and two spare wheels on a roof rack borrowed from the 'Surfing' Mini Traveller (485) from 1965.
Another rear engined police car was introduced in May 1968, the Sunbeam Imp 'Panda' car (506).
This line did not feature in Corgi catalogues.
