"Headlines" is a segment on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno airing weekly.
Since the early 1980s, David Letterman has been doing a similar segment called "Small Town News" (albeit on and off) on Late Night and The Late Show.
Conan O'Brien parodies Headlines on Late Night in a segment called Actual Items, which uses advertisements purposefully doctored by the show's prop and writing staffs.
