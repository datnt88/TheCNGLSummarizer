Full-size Ford is the popular term for a long-running line of Ford vehicles which have been produced in North America with a large degree of similarity since the Model T in 1908, up to the current Crown Victoria.
The term full-size does not necessarily indicate it was large relative to its competitors, but that it was the largest and most complete model offered by Ford.
If the Ford full-size line were to be taken as a continuous automotive line, it would comfortably be the longest in the car industry, with staggering collective production numbers.
