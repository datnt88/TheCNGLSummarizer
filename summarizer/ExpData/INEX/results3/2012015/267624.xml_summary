The other special-purpose card, the MTR Airport Staff Octopus, is available for the staff of Hong Kong International Airport and AsiaWorld-Expo, a convention centre close to the airport, for commuting at a reduced fare between the airport and MTR stations via the Airport Express.
Making or recording a payment using the card for public transportation or while purchasing items at Octopus-enabled retailers can be done by holding the card against or waving it over an Octopus card reader from up to a few centimetres away, even if the card is in a wallet or a purse.
As with the card itself, these products are used by waving them over a card reader.
