Zajdi, zajdi, jasno sonce (O Set, O Set, Clear Sun; Macedonian: Зајди, зајди, јасно сонце; Bulgarian: Зайди, зайди, ясно слънце) is a popular Macedonian and  Bulgarian song which has in recent times gained popularity throughout the Balkans.
The song is based on the text of a folk song collected by the Bulgarian writer Lyuben Karavelov in Veliko Turnovo in 1878.
According to folklorist Nikolai Kaufman, who finds the melody identical to that of an earlier Karavelov song, it is based on a Bulgarian folk song.
