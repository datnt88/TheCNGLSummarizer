Karolina released several singles off her first album, including "Sakaj me" ("Love me"), "Bez ogled na se"("No matter what") and "Nemir" ("Restless"), the latter of which she sang in a duet with To≈°e Proeski.
With her first album released, Karolina took part in the SkopjeFest Eurovision song selection.
Karolina and her record label thought that this would be a handicap and that Karolina should sing in English so she could successfully compete with the other nations.
