Vivienne "Viv" Michel is the main fictional character in Ian Fleming's James Bond novel The Spy Who Loved Me.
Bond and Viv then have sex again; this time, Viv describes Bond as making love to her "fiercely, almost cruelly," in a side-by-side position, with her again having an orgasm.
Viv possesses some unusual aspects for a Bond Girl; having a rather ordinary name, unlike most other Bond Girls, she is also one of the few Bond Girls not to be somehow involved in intelligence affairs or criminal enterprises.
