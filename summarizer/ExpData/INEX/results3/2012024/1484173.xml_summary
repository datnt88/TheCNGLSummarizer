Pussy Galore is a fictional character from the James Bond film and novel Goldfinger.
Pussy ranked number 2 in a poll of favourite Bond Girls in 2007, beaten only by Ursula Andress's character Honey Ryder.
Honor Blackman, in the Bond Girls Are Forever documentary, mentions she knows that Galore was written as a lesbian, and played the role as if she had been abused in the past.
