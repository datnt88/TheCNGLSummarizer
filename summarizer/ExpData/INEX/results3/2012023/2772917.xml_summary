Flute repertory is the general term for pieces composed for flute (particularly Western concert flute) and often played by flutists (or flautists).
Pieces with an "(O)" originally for flute and orchestra.
These "orchestral excerpts" are popular requirements in musical auditions for flute positions, and are often assigned individually as part of flute studies.
