It is sometimes used as a synonym for the tropical area of South America, although the ecozone also includes temperate southern South America.
The Neotropic includes more tropical rainforest (tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests) than any other ecozone, extending from southern Mexico through Central America and northern South America to southern Brazil, including the vast Amazon Rainforest.
These rainforest ecoregions are one of the most important reserves of biodiversity on Earth.
