Land which is unsuitable for arable farming usually has at least one of the following deficiencies: no source of fresh water; too hot (desert); too cold (Arctic); too rocky; too mountainous; too salty; too rainy; too snowy; too polluted; or too nutrient poor.
Non-arable land is sometimes called wasteland, badlands, worthless or no man's land.
However, non-arable land can be converted into arable land.
