General Rashid entered the Pakistan Military Academy in 1966.
He served in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 (during which he was premanently injured on the right cheek) and, later, in the Kargil War, the failure of which he was widely blamed for.
The event marked the beginning of the Kargil War, which ended with Pakistan's defeat and India regaining possession of Kargil.
