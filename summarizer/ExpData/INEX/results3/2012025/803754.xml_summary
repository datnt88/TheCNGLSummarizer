The Kargil War, also known as the Kargil conflict,(I) was an armed conflict between India and Pakistan that took place between May and July 1999 in the Kargil district of Kashmir.
There were three major phases to the Kargil War.
After the end of the war however, the Indian Government increasingly called it the "Kargil War", even though there had been no official declaration of war.
