The Simla Agreement  was signed between India and Pakistan at 12:40am on July 3, 1972.
The agreement has been the basis of all subsequent bilateral talks between India and Pakistan, though it has not prevented the relationship between the two countries from deteriorating to the point of armed conflict (most recently in the Kargil War).
Just like India's invasion of Siachen Glacier was a violation of the Simla Agreement by India, the 1999 Kargil War was a violation by Pakistan and therefore aberrant international conduct by both sides.
