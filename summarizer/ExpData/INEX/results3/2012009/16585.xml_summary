Gelatin has been well known and used for many years.
During this same period, Jell-O 1-2-3, a gelatin dessert that separated into three layers as it cooled, and Jell-O Whip 'n Chill, a mousse-style dessert, were also introduced and widely promoted; they remain available only in limited areas today.
