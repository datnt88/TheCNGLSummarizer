The Beirut Stock Exchange (or BSE) is the principal stock exchange of Lebanon.
Beirut Stock Exchange, the second oldest market in the region, was established in 1920 by a decree of the French commissioner.
In late 2006, the BSE launched a new Remote Trading System, allowing the brokers to trade with the securities listed on the BSE "remotely" from their own offices.
