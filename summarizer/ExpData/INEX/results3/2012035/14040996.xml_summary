The Eagles for St. Jude program is also supported by The Golf Channel, which provides season-long updates and promotional support for Eagles for St. Jude.
Additionally, Vijay Singh, who serves as the Eagles for St. Jude Ambassador, is personally donating $5,000 for every eagle he makes during the 2008 season and Camilo Villegas will donate $3,000 for each of his eagles.
During the 2007 PGA TOUR, 1,222 eagles were made, which resulted in Stanford Financial Group donating $1,222,000 to the Eagles for St. Jude program.
