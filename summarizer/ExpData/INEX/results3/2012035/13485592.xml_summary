The Australian Electoral Commission regulates donations to political parties, and publishes a yearly list of political donors.
Despite the Australian Electoral Commission publishing a yearly list of political donors, it is often difficult to ascertain who made the donation, as political parties sometimes use associated entities as front organisations to hide the source of the donations..
Associated entities have become huge political donors in Australia, in 2003-2004 donating $72.6 million to political parties.
