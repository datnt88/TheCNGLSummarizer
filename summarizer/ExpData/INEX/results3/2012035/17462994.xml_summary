Mobile donating refers to donating to an organization through a mobile device.
The primary means for mobile donating is through  SMS.  Mobile donating can also refer to consumers donating their old phones to a cause for recycling and reuse of the device.
Currently in the US non-profits can either foster a deal with each individual cell phone carrier or work with the Mobile Giving Foundation who acts as a gate keeper for the mobile carriers to certify NPOâ€™s and keep mobile donating standards.
