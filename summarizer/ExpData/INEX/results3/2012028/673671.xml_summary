An earthquake at 8:32Â a.m. on May 18, 1980 caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, suddenly exposing the partly molten, gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to lower pressure.
A volcanic ash column rose high into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states.
The area was later preserved, as it was, in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.
