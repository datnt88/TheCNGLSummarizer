Plinian eruptions are marked by columns of smoke and ash extending high into the stratosphere.
The longer eruptions begin with production of clouds of volcanic ash, optionally with pyroclastic flows.
The examples of large Plinian eruptions resulting in formation of a caldera are the 1883 Krakatoa eruption in Indonesia, the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, also in Indonesia, the 1667 &amp; 1739 eruptions of Mount Tarumae in Japan , the 1600 BC Thera eruption, and the 4860 BC eruption that formed the Crater Lake, and of course Vesuvius in AD 79, which was the prototypical Plinian Eruption.
