The Demon Murder Trial is the first known case in the United States of a lawyer claiming his client was innocent due to demonic possession.
Johnson was discovered two miles (3 km) from the site of the murder and was held at the Bridgeport Correctional Center on bail of 125,000 USD. It was the first murder in the history of Brookfield, Connecticut.
Johnson and his wife Debbie believe the account of demonic possession to be true, and that Glatzel is suing to make money.
