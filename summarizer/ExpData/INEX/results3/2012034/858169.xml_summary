Father Halloran was born in Jackson, Minnesota in 1921.
Father Halloran would helicopter in to the fighting zones, sometimes staying for days on end ministering to the soldiers.
In the publicity run up to the airing of the film, various television shows covered the topic of demonic possession with both Father Halloran and Thomas B. Allen appearing in segments speaking about the case.
