Sleepy People should not be confused with the Oregonian New Wave indie rock band The Sleepy People or Californian progressive rock band Sleeping People.
In 1994, the band issued their first album Blunt Nails In A Sharp Wall on self-released cassette.
The band’s tone became less fanciful and more sinister with a second single, “Freak” on the band’s own Bad Apple Records.
