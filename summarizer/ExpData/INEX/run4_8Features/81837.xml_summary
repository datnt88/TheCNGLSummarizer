The Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and glass building originally erected in Hyde Park, London, England, to house the Great Exhibition of 1851.
The name Crystal Palace (coined by the satirical magazine Punch'') was later used to denote this area of south London and the park that surrounds the site, home of the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre.
The New York Crystal Palace was built for the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations for the 1853 World's Fair on a site behind the Croton Distributing Reservoir, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues on 42nd Street (today's Bryant Park).
