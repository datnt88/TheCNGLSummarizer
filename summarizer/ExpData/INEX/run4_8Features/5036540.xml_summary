The 1634 case of demonic possession in Loudun, France, is arguably the most famous case of multiple or mass possession in history.
Either the Bishop of Poiters approached Father Mignon, confessor to the Ursuline nuns, and a plan was made to persuade a few of the sisters to feign possession and denounce Grandier, or Father Mignon was approached by the Mother Superior Jeanne des Anges (Joan of the Angels) for help.
In 1866, Jean-Martin Charcot analyzed the case of the Loudun Possessions.
