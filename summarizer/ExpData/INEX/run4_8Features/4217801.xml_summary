The Minoan eruption of Thera, also referred to as the Thera eruption or Santorini eruption,  was a major catastrophic volcanic eruption (VEI = 6, DRE = 60Â km3) which is estimated to have occurred in the mid second millennium BC. The eruption was one of the largest volcanic events on Earth in recorded history.
Significant Minoan remains have been found above the Late Minoan I era Thera ash layer, implying that the Thera eruption did not cause the immediate downfall of the Minoans.
However, there are connections between the Thera eruption and the calamities of the Admonitions of Ipuwer, a text from Lower Egypt during the Middle Kingdom or Second Intermediate Period.
