Another type of case is fraudulent claims of possession.
Maybe the most known work on the subject is the 1973 film The Exorcist, based on the book of the same name, which portrays a typical mediaeval case of demonic possession in which the victim shows all required characteristics to confirm the status of possessed.
End of Days (1999) shows another form of demonic possession suggested by Hilarius.
