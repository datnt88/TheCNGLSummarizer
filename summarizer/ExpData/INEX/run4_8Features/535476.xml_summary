Besides, the numbers above are difficult to translate into any meaningful steps because the NHTSA does not define a car or a light truck very well (the PT Cruiser is classified as a light truck whereas as Lexus LS430, a much heavier vehicle, is classified as a car).
So, it would not make sense to say that eliminating all light trucks (which includes minivans, SUVs and pickups) will eliminate incompatibility because there would still be smaller vehicles crashing into larger vehicles.
Although much of the crash incompatibility debate in recent years has centered around SUVs, the concept has been around far longer.
