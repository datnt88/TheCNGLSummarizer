Dr Launcelot Eric Richdale OBE (1900-1983) was a New Zealand teacher and notable amateur ornithologist.
Although his fieldwork was carried out in southern New Zealand, he spent some time studying overseas, as a Fulbright Fellow at Cornell University 1950-1951, as a Nuffield Research Fellow at the Edward Grey Institute for Bird Research 1952-1955 and, after retirement, again as a Nuffield Fellow, at the Zoological Society of London 1960-1963.
In addition, he authored two major books, "Sexual Behavior in Penguins" (University of Kansas Press, 1951), and "A Population Study of Penguins" (Clarendon Press, 1957).
