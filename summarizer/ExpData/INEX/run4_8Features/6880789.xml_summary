myki (pronounced IPA: ) is the name of the contactless smartcard ticketing system to be introduced on public transport in Victoria, Australia. myki is designed to replace a number of ticket systems in Victoria, primarily the current Metcard (metropolitan Melbourne) and V/Line (regional) ticketing systems.
myki gives customers the best fare for the way they travel and fares will continue to be based on the time-zone fares currently used under the Metcard system. myki will store monetary value (myki money) and travel days (myki pass). myki money calculates the best fare for the user's trip as they scan on and scan off throughout the system and caps to the applicable 2 hour, daily or weekly (Monday - Sunday) fare.
The Minister for Public Transport has instructed the TTA to focus the application of myki for transport fare payment before endeavouring on other retail concepts.
