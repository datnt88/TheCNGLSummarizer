The Growing Man is an android and was created for the supervillain, Kang the Conqueror.
Months later, Kang uses the Growing Man to abduct Tony Stark - the alter-ego of Iron Man - from a hospital.
Kang later revives the Growing Man and directs it against New York City, although Mister Fantastic devises a means of reversing the growing process, causing the android to shrink from sight.
