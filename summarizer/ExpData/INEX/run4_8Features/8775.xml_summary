In the Latin American docta, the admission to a Ph.D. program at an Argentine University requires the full completion of a Master's degree or a Licentiate's degree.
Funding typically lasts for three or four years for PhD students and four years for students earning both their Master's degree and PhD; there is a usually first-year assessment to remain in the programme and the thesis is submitted at the end of the 3-4 year program.
Depending on the specific field of study, completion of a Ph.D. program usually takes four to eight years of study after the Bachelor's Degree; those students who begin a Ph.D. program with a Master's Degree may complete their Ph.D. a year or two sooner.
