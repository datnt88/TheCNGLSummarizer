Like Suica and ICOCA, the underlying technology behind PiTaPa is Sony's FeliCa smart card system.
"PiTaPa Basic Card" is the name given to the PiTaPa cards per se, and are issued by the Surutto KANSAI Conference.
PiTaPa can be used in place of an ICOCA card if the user charges money on to the card beforehand.
