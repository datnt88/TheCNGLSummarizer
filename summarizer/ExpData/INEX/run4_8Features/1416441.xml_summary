On 23 January 2008 the New South Wales government cancelled the Tcard contract with Integrated Transit Solutions Limited (ITSL).
A replacement system, based on smart card technology, was first announced by the New South Wales Government in 1996.
On July 3, 2008 after 3 months of a terminated contract and a $200m lawsuit by ERG it was revealed that the Tcard system project had been revived by cabinet.
