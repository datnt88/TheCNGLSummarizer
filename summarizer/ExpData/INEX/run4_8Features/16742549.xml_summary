SAPICA (サピカ, Sapika) is a rechargeable contactless smart card ticketing system for public transport in Sapporo, Japan.
The Sapporo IC Card Council (札幌ICカード協議会, Sapporo Aishī Kādo Kyōgikai) will introduce the system from January 2009.
The integrated service with Kitaca, a smart card system to be introduced by JR Hokkaidō from autumn 2008, was once considered.
