Prince Shōtoku (聖徳太子, Shōtoku Taishi, 573–621), also known as Prince Umayado  (厩戸皇子, Umayado no ōji), was a regent and a politician of the Asuka period in Japan.
"From the sovereign of the land of the rising sun (nihon/hi izuru) to the sovereign of the land of the setting sun."There are historians who have concluded that Prince Shōtoku was not a historical person at all.
He is known by several titles, although his real name is Prince Umayado (厩戸皇子, Umayado no ōji, literally the prince of the stable door) since he was born in front of a stable.
