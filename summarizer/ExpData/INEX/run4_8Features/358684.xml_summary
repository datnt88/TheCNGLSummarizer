The movie was released on May 20, 1994 and serves as the origin of the Aladdin animated series.
After this, Jafar has Abis Mal take him to the palace, where he coerces Iago into serving him again.
When he sees Aladdin taking his lamp, Jafar attacks him with a blow that nearly knocks both Aladdin and Abis Mal off the edge of a now-crumbling balcony.
