The beach is divided into three roughly equal lengths, known as Saint Clair Beach, Middle Beach, and Saint Kilda Beach.
Access is easiest at the Saint Clair end, with steps and ramps down to the beach from Saint Clair Esplanade.
Saint Clair Beach is a popular surfing venue, as well as having a patrolled swimming area.
