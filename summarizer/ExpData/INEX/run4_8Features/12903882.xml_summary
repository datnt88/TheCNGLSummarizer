QSR International develops qualitative data analysis (QDA) software products designed to help qualitative researchers organize and analyze non-numerical or unstructured data.
QSR International’s software products – XSight and NVivo – are both designed to help researchers and other people working with non-numerical or unstructured data to compile, compare and make sense of their information quickly and easily.
NVivo is a Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) software package designed for qualitative researchers working with very rich text-based and/or mulitimedia information, where deep levels of analysis on small or large volumes of data are required.
