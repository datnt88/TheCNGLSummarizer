Bardot became the first Australian act to debut at the #1 position with both its debut single, "Poison", and self-titled debut album.
In July 2001, the group released "ASAP", the first single from their second album.
In May 2003, Monk released her debut solo album, Calendar Girl, which surprised many by mixing contemporary pop-dance and funk with classical opera interludes, Monk having been classically trained growing up.
