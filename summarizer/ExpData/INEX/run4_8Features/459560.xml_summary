The "Stillman Diet" is a high-protein, low-carbohydrate and low-fat diet.
It is regarded as one of the first low-carbohydrate diets to become popular in the US.  Other low-carbohydrate diets in the 1960s included Air Force Diet and the Drinking Manâ€™s Diet.
As a related note, there is a set of diets known as low-glycemic-index diets (low-GI diets) or low-glycemic-load diets (low-GL diets), in particular the Low GI Diet by Brand-Miller et al. In reality, low-carbohydrate diets are, literally speaking, low-GL diets (and vice versa) in that they specifically limit what contributes to the glycemic load in foods.
