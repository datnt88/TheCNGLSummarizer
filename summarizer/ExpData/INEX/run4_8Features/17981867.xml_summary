The Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Bus is a passenger bus service connecting Srinagar, the capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir (also Indian-administered Kashmir) with Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control (LoC)â€”the boundary line denoting rival areas of control in the disputed region of Kashmir, but which is not an official international border.
Both governments announced that the bus service could be used by Indian and Pakistani citizens wishing to travel anywhere in Indian Kashmir and Pakistani Kashmir, including the Northern Areas of Pakistan, which are part of India's claim on Kashmir and pre-1947 Kashmir.
The Indian government has proposed improving travel permit procedures, increasing the frequency of the bus service to weekly instead of a fortnight, and starting bus services connecting Kargil, India, with Skardu, Pakistan, and Jammu, India, with Sialkot, Pakistan.
