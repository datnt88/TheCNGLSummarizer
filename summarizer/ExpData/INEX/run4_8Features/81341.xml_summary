But our princess is in a another castle!" In Super Mario Bros. 2, a character named Toad made his first appearance as one of the four playable characters.
When the later Mario Tennis game, Mario Power Tennis, came out, Nintendo decided against bringing Toad back into the game alongside Birdo, Baby Mario and Donkey Kong Jr, though he did appear as a cameo with Toadette in the opening movie.
In Super Mario Galaxy, many Toads (as well as Toadette) appear at the beginning of the game, and later on, several Toads (but not Toadette) appear as the "Toad Brigade", helping Mario on his quest to defeat Bowser and save Princess Peach.
