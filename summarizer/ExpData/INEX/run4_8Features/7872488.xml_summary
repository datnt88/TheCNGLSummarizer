Highway Encounter is a computer game released on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64 by Vortex Software in 1985.
Players control a robotic "Vorton" (resembling a dalek from Doctor Who) and one of the things that provides Highway Encounter with its unique appeal is that the bomb is constantly being pushed onwards by your extra lives - four more Vortons, who accompany you along the highway.
Highway Encounter was followed by a sequel, Alien Highway in 1986.
