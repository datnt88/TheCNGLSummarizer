Armagnac (pronounced ) is a distinctive kind of brandy or eau de vie produced in the Armagnac region in Gascony, southwest France.
Production is overseen by INAO and the Bureau National Interprofessionel de l'Armagnac (BNIA).
Armagnac was one of the first areas in France to begin distilling spirits, however the brandies produced have a lower profile than those from Cognac, and the overall volume of production is far smaller.
