Therefore, the alcohol in wine could be a factor in the French paradox.
Law and Wald (1999) used Criqui and Ringelâ€™s (1994) study of alcohol and diet in explaining the French paradox.
Nevertheless, the medical causes of the French paradox are still not entirely clear and research continues while some researchers have questioned altogether the validity of this paradox by dismissing dietary saturated fat as a cause of coronary heart disease, a view that has recently received support when the results of the 20 year-long Nurses' Health Study run by the Harvard School of Public Health suggested, after accumulating over a decade of data on the diet and health of almost 300,000 Americans, that total fat consumed has no relation to heart disease risk, provided it is not trans fat.
