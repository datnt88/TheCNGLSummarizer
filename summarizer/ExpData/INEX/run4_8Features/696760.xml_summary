The Simla Agreement  was signed between India and Pakistan at 12:40am on July 3, 1972.
Simla Agreement on Bilateral Relations between India and Pakistan signed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and Prime Minister of Pakistan, Z.A. Bhutto, in Simla on July 2, 1972.
Just like India's invasion of Siachen Glacier was a violation of the Simla Agreement by India, the 1999 Kargil War was a violation by Pakistan and therefore aberrant international conduct by both sides.
