Next came SPECT and PET scans, which allowed scientists to map brain function because, unlike MRI and CT, these scans could create more than just static images of the brain's structure.
Besides fMRI, another example of technology allowing relatively older brain imaging techniques to be even more helpful is the ability to combine different techniques to get one brain map.
By looking at some current technologies, recent breakthroughs in brain imaging, and some of the implications of brain imaging, this article has barely begun to tip what is building up to be an enormous iceberg.
