On sloping sites the cryptoporticus is often partially at ground level and supports a structure such as a forum or Roman villa, in which case it served as basis villae.
The cryptoporticus of Reims, formerly enclosing three sides of the forum, is of Gallo-Roman origin and was probably built during the 3rd century.
Other well-known examples include the cryptoporticus of Hadrian's Villa and that of the House of the Cryptoporticus in Pompeii.
