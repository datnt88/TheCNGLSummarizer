RapiCa (ラピカ, Rapika) is a rechargeable contactless smart card ticketing system for public transport in Kagoshima, Japan, introduced by Kagoshima City Transportation Bureau, Nangoku Kōtsū, and JR Kyūshū Bus, from April 1, 2005.
RapiCa and Iwasaki IC Card have integrated services, meaning either card can be used for most bus lines in the city.
A future smart card to be introduced by JR Kyūshū will have an integrated service too.
