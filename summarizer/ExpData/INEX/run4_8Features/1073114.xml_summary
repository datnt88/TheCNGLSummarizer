Gadolin discovered the chemical element yttrium.
The oxide of the element gadolinium, gadolinia, was named after Gadolin by its discoverers.
In an earlier paper in 1788 Gadolin showed that the same element can show several oxidation states, in his case Sn(II) and Sn(IV) 'by combining itself with larger or smaller amounts of the calcinating substance'.
