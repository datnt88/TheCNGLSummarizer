Block-style figures are a type of collectible toy action figures marked by a generally simplistic representation of the human form, usually comprised of block-shaped apendages and torsos.
The first widely produced block-style figures were arguably released by LEGO in 1974 and known as "minifigures".
Since their advent, multiple forms of the block-style figure have arisen in the collectible toy market.
