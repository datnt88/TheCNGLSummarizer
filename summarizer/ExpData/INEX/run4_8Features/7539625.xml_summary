Waitati is a small seaside settlement in Otago, New Zealand, within the city limits of Dunedin.
The Main South Line railway curves from east to north through Waitati and a tourist train, the Seasider, travels through here between Dunedin and Palmerston once or twice a week.
Waitati is the site of a school, a branch of the Dunedin Public Libraries, a garden centre, a cafe and a general store.
