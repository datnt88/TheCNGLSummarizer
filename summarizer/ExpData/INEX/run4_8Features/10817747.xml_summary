Kenneth Lane Thompson (born February 4 1943), commonly referred to as Ken Thompson (or simply ken in hacker circles), is an American pioneer of computer science notable for his work with the B programming language and his shepherding the Unix and Plan 9 operating systems.
Regular expressions became pervasive in Unix text processing programs (such as grep), and even in some modern programming languages like Perl; they are a central concept in Rob Pike's sam text editor.
On April 27 1999, Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the 1998 National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton  for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which together have led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age.
