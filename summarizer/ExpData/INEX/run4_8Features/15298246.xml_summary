Samuel H. Wood is a scientist noted for donating DNA that was used in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to produce mature human embryos that were clones of Dr Wood.
In January 2008, Wood and Andrew French, Stemagen's chief scientific officer in California, announced that they had successfully created the first 5 mature human embryos using DNA from adult skin cells, aiming to provide a less-controversial source of viable embryonic stem cells.
Dr. Wood and five other researchers published their findings in the online research journal Stem Cells, in an article entitled Development of Human cloned Blastocyst Following Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT) with Adult Fibroblasts.
