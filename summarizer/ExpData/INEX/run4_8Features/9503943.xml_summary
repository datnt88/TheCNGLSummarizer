Grain mixes with added molasses are usually called "Sweet feed" in the USA and "Coarse mix" in the United Kingdom.
To do so, horse feed is measured by weight, not volume.
Horses accidentally getting into stored feed and eating too much at one time is a common but preventable way that horses develop colic or laminitis.  (see Illnesses related to improper feeding below)
