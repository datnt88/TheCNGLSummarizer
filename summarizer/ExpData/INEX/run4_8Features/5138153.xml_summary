Enchanted is the first feature-length Disney live-action/traditional animation hybrid since Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), though the traditionally-animated characters do not interact in the live-action environment in the same manner as they did in Roger Rabbit; however, there are some scenes where live-action characters share the screen with two-dimensional animated characters, e.g., a live-action Nathaniel communicating with a cel-drawn Narissa.
"Happy Working Song" pays an homage to such songs as "Whistle While You Work" (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), "The Work Song" (Cinderella) and "A Spoonful of Sugar" (Mary Poppins) while "That's How You Know" is a self-parody of Menken's compositions for his Disney features, specifically such big production numbers as "Under the Sea" (The Little Mermaid) and "Be Our Guest" (Beauty and the Beast).
Gibbons, along with James W. Brown, David Richard Nelson and John Koester, were nominated for an Visual Effects Society Award in the Outstanding Animated Character in a Live Action Motion Picture category for the animated chipmunk, Pip, while costume designer Mona May received a nomination for Excellence in Costume Design for Film - Fantasy for her work in Enchanted at the Costume Designers Guild Awards 2007.
