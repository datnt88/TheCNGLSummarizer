Mark Bellinghaus (born July 20, 1963), is a Marilyn Monroe activist and a collector of Monroe memorabilia.
It was promoted as the "biggest and best collection of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia on display, ever." The value of the exhibit was announced as $10 million, and the show was successfully inaugurated on November 10, 2005, with a panel discussion held by CMG CEO Mark Roesler, Hugh Hefner, Robert Otto, Mary Jane Popp and June DiMaggio (DiMaggio had been the source for 30 of the show items).
In October 2007, Bellinghaus contested and debunked the authenticity of "The Lost Collection", an exhibit which claimed to display seven dresses made by Marilyn Monroe's designer William Travilla, which were advertised as worn by Monroe in her movies.
