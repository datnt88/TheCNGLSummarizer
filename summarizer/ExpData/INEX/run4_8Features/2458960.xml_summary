Anneliese Michel (September 21, 1952 – July 1, 1976) was a German  Catholic woman who was said to be possessed by demons and subsequently underwent an exorcism.
The Roman Catholic Church, which had authorized the exorcism, reversed its position and declared Anneliese Michel a case of mental illness.
The accused exorcists — Anneliese’s parents and the two priests — were discouraged from seeing the remnants of Anneliese.
