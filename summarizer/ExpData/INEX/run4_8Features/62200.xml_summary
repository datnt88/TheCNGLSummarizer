For example, although ununoctium is a member of the noble gas group, it could have a higher chemical reactivity than some elements outside this group.
In addition to being far more reactive than radon, ununoctium may be even more reactive than elements 114 and 112.
By extrapolating this to the other noble gases, it is expected that ununoctium has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This is very different from the previously estimated values of 263 K or 247 K. Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that element 118 would be a gas under standard conditions.
