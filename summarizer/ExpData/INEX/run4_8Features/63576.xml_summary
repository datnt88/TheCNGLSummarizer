When he was a druggist and chemist in Atlanta, Georgia, Pemberton began work on a coca and kola (cola) nut beverage.
Pemberton used an old family recipe from his African American maid's family for the original Coca Cola formula, as a nonalcoholic alternative to his French Wine Coca in the event that the pending national temperance movement prohibited the sale of the latter.
Pemberton died on August 16, 1888, only a few months after Candler incorporated the first Coca Cola Corporation.
