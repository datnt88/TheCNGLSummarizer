For other uses, see Catch and release (disambiguation).
In Switzerland, catch and release fishing is considered inhumane and will be banned beginning in September 2008.
Fishermen have been practicing catch and release for decades, including with some highly pressured fish species, and no significant, measurable effects from catch and release have been observed, indicating that mortality rates from catch and release are not excessive.
