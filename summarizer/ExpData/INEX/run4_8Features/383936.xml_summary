The new name is literally translated as "strong bolívar", but also references an old coin called the Peso fuerte worth 10 Spanish reales..
Coins are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 12½, 25 and 50 céntimos and 1 bolívar.
5 bolívar notes were issued between 1966 and 1974, when they were replaced by coins.
