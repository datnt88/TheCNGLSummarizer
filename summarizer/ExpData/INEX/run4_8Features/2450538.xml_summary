The Jiangling Motors Landwind or JMC Landwind (Chinese: 陆风汽车) is a Chinese-built SUV. It is also sold in some European markets, being the first Chinese vehicle that has ever been exported to Europe.
The Landwind has attracted a controversy after a series of safety tests.
The Dutch importer of the Landwind called for a test by German safety monitoring agency TÜV to show that the car was in fact safe enough for European standards.
