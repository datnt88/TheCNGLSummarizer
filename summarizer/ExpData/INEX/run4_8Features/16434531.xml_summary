Main article: Single photon emission computed tomographySPECT is a branch of Nuclear Medicine and can be used to complement any gamma imaging study, where a true 3D representation can be helpful.
When it is attached to HMPAO, this allows 99mTc to be taken up by brain tissue in a manner proportial to brain blood flow, in turn allowing brain blood flow to be assessed with the nuclear gamma camera.
99mTc-HMPAO SPECT scanning competes with FDG PET scanning of the brain, which works to assess regional brain glucose metabolism, to provide very similar information about local brain damage from many processes.
