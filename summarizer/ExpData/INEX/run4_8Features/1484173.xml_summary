Pussy Galore is a fictional character from the James Bond film and novel Goldfinger.
Blackman and Diana Rigg are furthermore the only two Bond girls who are older than Bond himself; Sean Connery was only 34 when filming Goldfinger, while Rigg was 31 when filming On Her Majesty's Secret Service opposite the then 30-year-old George Lazenby.
Honor Blackman, in the Bond Girls Are Forever documentary, mentions she knows that Galore was written as a lesbian, and played the role as if she had been abused in the past.
