Since the Japanese firm Morita Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. produced the first commercial stevia sweetener in Japan in 1971, the Japanese have been using stevia in food products, soft drinks (including Coca Cola), and for table use.
In Japan and South American countries, stevia may also be used as a food additive.
Stevia is currently banned for use in food in the European Union.
