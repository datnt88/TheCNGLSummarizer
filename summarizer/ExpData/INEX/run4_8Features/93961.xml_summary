Crystal Palace is a residential area in South London, England named from the erstwhile local landmark, The Crystal Palace, which occupied the area from 1854 to 1936.
It is the location of Crystal Palace Park, which is entirely contained within the London Borough of Bromley.
This has led to the Crystal Palace area straddling the boundaries of five London Boroughs; Bromley, Croydon, Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham.
