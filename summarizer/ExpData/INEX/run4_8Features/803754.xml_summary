The Kargil War, also known as the Kargil conflict,(I) was an armed conflict between India and Pakistan that took place between May and July 1999 in the Kargil district of Kashmir.
The Kargil War was significant for the impact and influence of the mass media on public opinion in both nations.
After the end of the war however, the Indian Government increasingly called it the "Kargil War", even though there had been no official declaration of war.
