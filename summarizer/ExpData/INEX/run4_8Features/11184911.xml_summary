In Silver-gelatin photography, the emulsion consists of silver halide crystals suspended in gelatin, and the substrate may be glass, plastic film, paper or fabric.
Photographic emulsion consists of a fine supension of insoluble light-sensitive crystals in a colloid sol, usually containing gelatin.
The light-exposed crystals are reduced by the developer to black metallic silver particles that form the image and the photographic "grain." The emulsion of colour films is usually multi-layered.
