Friedrich Ernst Dorn (27 July 1848 â€“ 16 December 1916) was a German physicist who was the first to discover that a radioactive substance, later named radon, is emitted from radium.
In 1885, at Halle University, Dorn took over the position of personal ordinarius professor for theoretical physics from Anton Oberbeck.
Dorn verified Rutherford's observation that a radioactive material was emitted by thorium, and discovered that a similar emission arose from the element radium.
