The triumphal arch near the Roman town of Glanum, just outside Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, shows Roman soldiers leading away defeated prisoners.
It was built according to the principles of Vitruvius, the chief theorician of Roman architecture.
The Baptistry of the Cathedral of Saint-Léonce at Frejus (406-409 A.D.), built shortly before the fall of the Roman Empire,  is the oldest Christian structure in Provence, and one of the oldest buildings in France.
