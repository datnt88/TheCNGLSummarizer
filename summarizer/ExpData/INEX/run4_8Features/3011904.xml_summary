Blackberry thumb is a form of repetitive strain injury caused by the frequent use of the thumb(s) to press buttons on PDAs, smart phones, or other mobile devices.
Symptoms of Blackberry thumb include aching and throbbing pain in the thumb or sometimes other fingers and in the wrist.
Experts recommend that Blackberry thumb can be prevented by use of other fingers to press buttons on handheld devices, and to vary which fingers are being used.
