On the show, Seinfeld played a caricature of himself.
About his influences, Seinfeld, in his commentary for "The Gymnast" episode on "Seinfeld, Season 6," said, "He really formed my entire comedic sensibility--I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd." Seinfeld also holds the distinction of being the only actor to appear in every episode of the show.
There are also several books about both the sitcom and Seinfeld himself, though many of them are not written by Seinfeld.
