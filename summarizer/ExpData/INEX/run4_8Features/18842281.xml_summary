A keyset or chorded keyboard (also called a chord keyboard or chording keyboard) is a computer input device that allows the user to enter characters or commands formed by pressing several keys together, like playing a "chord" on a piano.
A chorded keyboard designed to be used while held in the hand is called a keyer.
FITALY (http://www.FITALY.com) is a stylus/one-finger keyboard that can yield 50+ WPM.  The key is to stare at the keyboard, not the screen (as in traditional touch typing).
