The BMW X5 is a mid-size crossover SUV sold by BMW since 1999.
4 years later, the BMW X3 was released, which used the "X" prefix applied to the BMW SUVs which were derivatives of the BMW number-series models.
On November 15, 2007, the IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) announced that the current X5 and X3 models were the top safety picks for all mid-size SUV models.
