Although grep is not strictly an acronym, the letters are taken from global / regular expression / print, a series of instructions for the ed text editor.
The grep command searches files or standard input globally for lines matching a given regular expression, and prints them to the program's standard output.
The word "grep" has also become a synonym for regular expressions themselves.
