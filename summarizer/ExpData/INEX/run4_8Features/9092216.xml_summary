Full-size Ford is the popular term for a long-running line of Ford vehicles which have been produced in North America with a large degree of similarity since the Model T in 1908, up to the current Crown Victoria.
Thus, the inclusion of the Ford Five Hundred and fifth-generation Ford Taurus into this classification is contentious, even though they are full-size cars by Ford, as they are front-wheel drive with a monocoque design, independent suspension, and a V6 engine only.
Likewise, the Ford Zephyr and other internationally-produced big Fords have major mechanical and cultural differences from the American full-size lineage.
