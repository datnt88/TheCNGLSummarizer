LEGO Mindstorms is a line of Lego sets combining programmable bricks with electric motors, sensors, Lego bricks, and Lego Technic pieces (such as gears, axles, and beams).
Little is known about the reasoning behind this number, except for the use of technical support and as a ID number of the RCX for your Lego Mindstorms account on the Lego RCX website(The Lego RCX website was discontinued in 2003).
The RCX can control the Scout brick using the "Send IR Message" program block.
