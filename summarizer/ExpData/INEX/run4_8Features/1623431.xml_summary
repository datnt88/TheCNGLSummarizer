Of Exorcisms and Certain Supplications (Latin: De Exorcismis et Supplicationibus Quibusdam) is an 84-page document of the Roman Catholic church describing the rite of exorcism.
Following the trends in Catholic approaches to alleged cases of possession since the pontificate of Leo XIII in the nineteenth century, the new revision includes a warning not to confuse mental illness with demonic possession.
There are several different forms of ritual that may be used for minor exorcisms, including the Prayer against Satan and the Rebellious Angels of Leo XIII.
