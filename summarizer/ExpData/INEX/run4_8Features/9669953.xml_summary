Following the events of The Sheriff and the Satellite Kid, Sheriff Hall and H-725 (here named Charlie Warren) still get no rest from the military: because the little alien has not yet grasped the meaning of keeping a low profile, they are constantly on the move, and H-725â€™s father has to pick them out of a tight spot too many times already.
But this arouses the suspicion of the alien leader (Claudio Undali); he has Hall arrested for snooping into matters of national security and Charlie kidnapped.
The alien leader tries to activate a self-destruct device, but the sheriff takes a swing at him and he shatters like glass (probably to avoid censorship).
