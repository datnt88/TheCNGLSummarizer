The search and replace features of NoteTab are much more powerful than most text editors, and include regular expressions and a hierarchical search/replace of text in folders on a disk drive.
For example, you can read Outline and EBCDIC files but not write them; the disk search facility is present but not disk replace; and the clipbars, customizable menu shortcuts, spell checker and thesaurus are not available.  (These "commercial features" can be "turned on" once from within the software, and be used for up to 30 days.)  However, these features are hardly indispensable for most purposes and NoteTab Light works perfectly well as a fully-fledged editor.
