Normandy (French: Normandie, Norman: Normaundie) is a geographical region corresponding to the former Duchy of Normandy.
The descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local Gallo-Romantic language and intermarried with the area’s previous inhabitants and became the Normans – a Norman French-speaking mixture of Scandinavians, Hiberno-Norse, Orcadians, Anglo-Danish, and indigenous Franks and Gauls.
Although the British surrendered claims to mainland Normandy and other French possessions in 1801,  the monarch of the United Kingdom retains the title Duke of Normandy in respect to the Channel Islands.
