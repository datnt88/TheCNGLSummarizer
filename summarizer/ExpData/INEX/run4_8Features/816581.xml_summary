Birkbeck station is a railway station and light rail stop in the London Borough of Bromley in the southern suburbs of London.
The line was opened as a double-track branch of the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway in 1858, but was closed from 1915 until reopened on March 2 1930 as part of the Southern Railway electrification scheme.
A proposed line alternative through Birkbeck station from Crystal Palace railway station to Beckenham Junction was considered for conversion to a Tramlink route but Transport for London has dropped the plan on the grounds that the  existing rail service is adequate.
