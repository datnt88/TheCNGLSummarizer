Put another way, a chemical element cannot be transformed into other chemical elements by chemical processes.
The atomic number of an element, Z, is equal to the number of protons which defines the element.
Later chemical elements were also assigned unique chemical symbols, based on the name of the element, but not necessarily in English.
