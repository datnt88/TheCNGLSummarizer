The Doctor and Sarah find themselves in the English village of Devesham near a Space Defence Station.
The Doctor and Sarah duck and run, with the four in pursuit.
Sarah and the Doctor make their way back to the TARDIS. Sarah says she is going to take a taxi home, but when the Doctor offers to take her home instead, she smiles, "How can I refuse?" The two enter the ship and it vanishes.
