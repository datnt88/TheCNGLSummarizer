The Daewoo Winstorm is a crossover SUV developed by General Motors's GM Daewoo design center in Bupyeong, South Korea.
The Winstorm, which is given the model designation C100 is based on the GM Theta platform, and is derived from the S3X concept car.
The Theta platform is also used to underpin Opel Antara, the Winstorm's mechanical derivative also built by Daewoo.
