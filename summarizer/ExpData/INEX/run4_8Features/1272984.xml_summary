Because of its proximity to the wrist joint, this injury is often called a wrist fracture.
Specific types of distal radius fractures are Colles' fracture; Smith's fracture; Barton's fracture; Chauffeur's fracture (so called because the crank used to start old cars often kicked back and broke the chauffeurs' wrists with a particular pattern).
Stiffness of the wrist is universal following a fracture of the distal radius.
