An example of a boy racer car of the old generation is the Ford Escort (both the early rear wheel drive versions such as the RS2000 and the later XR3i variants) due to their low cost and easily tuned engine, while modern boy racers generally use hot hatchbacks such as the Renault Clio and the Nova SR.
Most 'boy racers' do not associate themselves with the term, and instead think of themselves as car enthusiasts.
These are the few who give most "Boy Racers" (RE: Car Enthusiasts) a bad name, by driving dangerously and are a hazard to the public.
