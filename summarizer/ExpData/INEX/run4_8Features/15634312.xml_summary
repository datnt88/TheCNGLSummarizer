The Puff model is a volcanic ash tracking model developed at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Puff was initially conceived and developed by Prof. H. Tanaka as a novel method for simulating ash cloud trajectories during the eruption of Mt. Redoubt, 1989.
The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) provided support for Puff through a post doctorate position (Drs. Mark Servilla and Jon Dehn) during the late 1990's to support analysis of volcanic clouds during eruptions.
