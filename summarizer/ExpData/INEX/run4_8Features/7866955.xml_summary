"Life" was the FYR Macedonia's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, performed in English (the first time the Macedonian entry had not featured at least some of the country's native language) by To≈°e Proeski.
The song is more well-known for its unusual performance, which began with Proeski ostensibly alone on stage.
At the close of voting, it had received 47 points, placing 14th in a field of 24 and thus returning FYR Macedonia to the semi-final at their next Contest appearance.
