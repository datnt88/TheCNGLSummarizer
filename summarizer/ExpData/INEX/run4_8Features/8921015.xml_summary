In this article types of eruption will be used to refer to the mechanism causing the eruption.
Large plinian eruptions — such as during 18 May 1980 at Mount St. Helens or, more recently, during 15 June 1991 at Pinatubo in the Philippines — can send ash and volcanic gas tens of kilometres into the atmosphere.
Only five of these types of eruptions have occurred in the present day.
