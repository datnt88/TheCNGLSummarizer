In Argentina, the Licentiate degree (Castilian: Licenciatura) is a 4-5 year degree (6 years in some cases under the accomplishment of the licentia doctorandi thesis dissertation), generally equivalent to an M.Sc. or M.A. in North American universities.
Most universities do not require a thesis to graduate at the Licentiate level, but for a number of years, it was the only method by which a graduate could qualify for his or her title from the National University (UNAM); some colleges, such as ITESO, forgo the thesis for one year of professional practice.
After the Bologna Process, the Licenciatura became an undergraduate academic degree awarded to students by higher education institutions after a 3 or 4 year 1st cycle of study at a university, polytechnical institute or other higher education institution.
