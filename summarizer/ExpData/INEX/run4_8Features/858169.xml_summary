Father Walter Halloran, SJ (September 21, 1921 â€“ March 1, 2005) was a Jesuit Roman Catholic priest who, at the age of twenty-six, assisted in the exorcism of a thirteen year old Lutheran boy in St. Louis, Missouri who allegedly became possessed after using a Ouija board.
Although the weeks in which he helped with this case of possession would make him a reluctant minor celebrity he regarded the exorcism as just one event in his life and not the most important.
In the publicity run up to the airing of the film, various television shows covered the topic of demonic possession with both Father Halloran and Thomas B. Allen appearing in segments speaking about the case.
