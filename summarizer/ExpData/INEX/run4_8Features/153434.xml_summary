Mario Golf is a sports video game series that was developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo.
The N64 and Game Boy Color versions can communicate each other via Transfer Pak connectivity, and the GameCube and GBA versions can do the same via the Nintendo GameCube-Game Boy Advance cable.
Other characters, created by Camelot Software Planning, have also been playable in the Mario Golf series ever since the Nintendo 64 iteration.
