"The Bart Wants What it Wants" is the eleventh episode of The Simpsons' thirteenth season.
Bart finds Greta at a movie studio named Paramountie Studios (a parody of Paramount Pictures), but after Bart and Milhouse get in a big fight that ends up interrupting a curling match, Greta declares she has no interest whatsoever in either Bart or Milhouse.
The episode received a mediocre review in the Toronto Star.
