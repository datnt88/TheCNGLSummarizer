Marples' Penguin (Palaeeudyptes marplesi) was a large species of the extinct penguin genus Palaeeudyptes.
The precise relationship between this species and the slightly smaller Narrow-flippered Penguin (Palaeeudyptes antarcticus) from somewhat younger rocks is not resolved; possibly, P. marplesi is a synonym or subspecies of P. antarcticus.
However, as most of them are only roughly dated and intermediate in size between this species and P. antarcticus, they should not be referred to either taxon pending a comprehensive review of the New Zealand material of Palaeeudyptes (which will probably result in recognizing that P. marplesi was a larger progenitor species or subspecies of P. antarcticus).
