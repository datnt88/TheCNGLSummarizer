Thornton came to the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California at Berkeley in 1933 and most of his later career was connected with that Laboratory where he worked with Professor Ernest Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron.
Lawrence sent Thornton to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor to lead in the construction of a cyclotron, and where he was also an instructor in Physics from 1936 to 1938.
Thornton left Berkeley again in 1940, this time to Washington University at St. Louis, as an associate professor of physics, to head the construction of a cyclotron, one of the best of its time.
