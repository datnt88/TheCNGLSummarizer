For the video game starring her, see Super Princess Peach.
Super Princess Peach marked the second time that Princess Peach was cast as the main hero in a video game, as Princess Peach had to save Mario and Luigi from King Bowser.
Although Super Princess Peach and Mario Hoops 3-on-3 still used Taylor's voice, other games, such as  and Super Mario Strikers have a new Peach voice, Nicole Mills.
