During this time, Chrysler began designing the replacement for the then-new Dodge Dynasty, which was a mid-size car.
The first generation of LH cars debuted with fanfare at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit as three 1993 models: the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid (badged as a Chrysler in Canada) and the Eagle Vision (badged as a Chrysler in Europe).
The Intrepid SXT was basically a base model Intrepid SE with the 3.5 H.O. engine taken from the R/T. It was a value trim model actually classified as an ES (SXT), but had less features than the ES did with a more powerful motor.
