For the Police Interceptor version used by law enforcement, see Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor.
The Ford Crown Victoria is the current model name Ford uses for the rear-wheel drive full-size car first produced by the Ford Motor Company for the North American market in the mid-1950s.
Starting with the 1999 model year, the police version of the Crown Victoria, previously named Crown Victoria P71, was changed to Police Interceptor and new rear badging was assigned instead of the civilian Crown Victoria badge.
