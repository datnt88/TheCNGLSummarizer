A brickfilm is any film made using LEGO, Mega Bloks, or other similar plastic construction block toys.
The first ever brickfilm was made between 1985-1989 in Perth, Western Australia by Lindsay Fleay.
The brickfilming hobby has spawned several online communities, including Bricks in Motion and Brickfilms LLC.
