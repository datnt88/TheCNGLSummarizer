The research evidence includes a study of over 120,000 subjects in the Netherlands that found no significant relationship between drinking and bladder cancer,  a study of high alcohol intake northern Italians tht found no association, even at high levels of consumption, a study in Massachusetts that fouind no association, except that beer significantly reduced bladder cancer risk ." and a study in Los Angeles County that found that "alcohol consumption was strongly associated with reduced risk of bladder cancer."
A study concluded, "In conclusion, even though our study did not show a clear association between alcohol intake and leukemia risk, some of the patterns of the risk estimates (a possible J-shaped dose-response curve between alcohol intake and ALL, AML, and CLL risks, and the positive association between alcohol and CML), may be suggestive."
The National Cancer Institute,  the American Cancer Society,  the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the National Institutes of Health  the Sloan-Kettering Medical Center  and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center  have all concluded, on the basis of the research evidence, that alcohol doesn't increase the risk of lung cancer.
