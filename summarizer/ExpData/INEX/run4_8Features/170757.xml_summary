Cyclotron radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted by moving charged particles deflected by a magnetic field.
Cyclotron radiation is emitted by all charged particles travelling through magnetic fields, however, not just those in cyclotrons.
Radiation reaction acts as a resistance to motion in a cyclotron; and the work necessary to overcome it is the main energetic cost of accelerating a particle in a cyclotron.
