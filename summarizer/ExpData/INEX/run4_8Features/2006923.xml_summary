Servbot (Kobun in Japan, which roughly means "little follower") are a series of characters from the Mega Man Legends'' series.
They first appear in Mega Man Legends as an enemy of sorts which Tron sends to rob banks and cause a general commotion.
However, by Mega Man Legends 2, the Servbots begin to treat Mega Man more kindly (though still antagonistically), thanks in part to their mother's crush on Mega Man.
