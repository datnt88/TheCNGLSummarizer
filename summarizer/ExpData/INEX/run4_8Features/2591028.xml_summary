Philip Bond was born in Lancashire, England in 1966, and is "the son of a preacherman." His earliest comics work came out of his being "active in the British alternative comics scene from 1987," and he writes on his website that, in 1988:"I was sat on the floor of Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin's single room flat pasting up the first issue of our self-published ATOMTAN magazine."Atomtan, Bond's first work, was a self-published fanzine created with Tank Girl creators Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett, along with Luke Whitney and Jane Oliver.
Between November 1995 and January 1996, Bond inked Alan Grant's take on Tank Girl in Vertigo's Tank Girl: Apocalypse and worked on several issues of Morrison's The Invisibles in 1999/2000.
Bond says he was originally going to work on We3, but Morrison - with whom Bond has "an understanding because we both like what one another does" - "had this other idea that he thought I would be great for," leading to Bond illustrating Vimanarama, and Frank Quitely drawing We3.
