The Atwater system (after Wilbur Olin Atwater) or derivatives of this system are used for the calculation of the available energy of foods.
The Gross Energy of a food, as measured by bomb calorimetry is equal to the sum of the heats of combustion of the components - protein (GEp), fat (GEf) and carbohydrate (GEcho) (by difference) in the proximate system.
where Dp, Df, and Dcho are respectively the digestibility coefficients of protein, fat and carbohydrate calculated as
