In 1989 a proposal was submitted to the National Science Foundation by representatives of Florida State University, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the University of Florida for a new national user laboratory supporting research in high magnetic fields.
Following a peer-review competition, the National Science Foundation awarded the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory to Florida State University in 1990.
The program is an integral component of the Magnet Lab and continues to be the first and only high pulsed field user facility in the United States.
