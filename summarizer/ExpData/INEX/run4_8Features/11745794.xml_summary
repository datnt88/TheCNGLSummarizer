Between June 1986 and January 1987, Professor Derek Tribe with support from Australian aid (ADAB, now AusAID), the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) and the CGIAR Secretariat, explored the possibilities of establishing a national support organisation in Australia.
At the time the Fund was established, the Academy defined its role as making “more widely known throughout Australia the benefits that accrue both internationally and to Australia from international agricultural research, and to encourage greater support for, and participation in, international agricultural R&amp;D by Australian governmental and non-governmental organisations and, in particular, the industrial, farming and scientific communities in Australia”.
The Crawford Fund provides two prestigious training Fellowships, the Derek Tribe Award and the Crawford Fund Fellowship from a private donor.
