The Air-Walker (Gabriel Lan) is a character in the fictional Marvel Universe.
Believing itself to be the original Gabriel Lan, the Air-Walker attempts to find the Surfer, but encounters the Thunder God, Thor.
Years later Firelord and the Surfer revive the android to aid in a battle against Galactus' most ruthless Herald, Morg,  who later completely destroys the Air-Walker.
