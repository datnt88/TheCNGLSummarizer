The DataHand keyboard was introduced in 1995 by DataHand Systems, Inc.  Before that it was produced by Industrial Innovations as early as 1992.
This allows you to place each hand wherever it is most comfortable to you.
The keyboard layout is initially similar to a QWERTY keyboard, but the middle two columns of keys (i.e. H,Y,G...) have been delegated to sideways finger movements, and all of the keys outside of the main three rows are accessed through two additional modes, including a mode for mousing.
