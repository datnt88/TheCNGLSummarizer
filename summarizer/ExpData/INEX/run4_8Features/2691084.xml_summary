The Arènes de Lutèce are among the most important remains from the Gallo-Roman era in Paris (formerly known as Lutèce in French or Lutetia in Latin), together with the Thermes de Cluny.
Standing in the center of the arena one can still observe significant remnants of the stage and its nine niches, as well as the grilled cages in the wall.
One is a passageway through the building at 47, rue Monge; the second is a long open corridor (vomitoir) accessible from rue de Navarre through a gate; the third is through the Square Capitan from its entrance at 10, rue des Arènes.
