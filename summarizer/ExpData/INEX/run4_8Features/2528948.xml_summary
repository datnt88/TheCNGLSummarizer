British Airways Flight 9, sometimes referred to as the Jakarta incident, was a scheduled British Airways flight from London Heathrow to Auckland, with stops in Mumbai, Chennai, Kuala Lumpur, Perth, and Melbourne.
After landing, the flight crew then found it impossible to taxi, as glare from apron floodlights made the windscreen opaque, and City of Edinburgh had to wait for a tug to tow her in.
Once the flight cleared the ash cloud, the crew was able to restart each engine and then make a safe landing at Anchorage.
