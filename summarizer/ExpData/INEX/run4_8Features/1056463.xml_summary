Eugène Joseph Bozza (April 4 1905 – September 28 1991) was a French composer.
His chamber music for winds shows great familiarity with the capabilities of the instruments, often demanding a great deal of technical skill, without losing the expressive, melodic style typical of 20th century French chamber music; his music is part of the standard repertoire for several instruments.
