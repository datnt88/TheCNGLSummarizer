nimoca (ニモカ, Nimoka) is a rechargeable contactless smart card ticketing system for public transport in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan.
In future, there will be two other systems in Fukuoka, SUGOCA by Kyūshū Railway Company (JR Kyūshū) and Hayakaken by Fukuoka City Transportation Bureau, both to be introduced from spring 2009.
The three cards in Fukuoka and Suica, a card already used in Greater Tokyo Area by East Japan Railway Company (JR East), will have integrated services from spring 2010.
