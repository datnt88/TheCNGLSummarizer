He initially considered to enroll for the Ph.D. with a biography of well-known Holocaust denier David Irving as a dissertion topic, apparently at Irving's suggestion, but instead embarked on a study of German air operations during World War II. In 1994, the U.S. Air Force Historical Research Agency, located within the Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, awarded him a research scholarship to conduct research for his dissertation in its archives; he subsequently received a research fellowship from the Federal Government of Germany which enabled him to conduct doctoral research in the German Military Archives in Freiburg, Germany.
From 1997 to 2004 he was also lecturer at the Officer Cadet School of the New Zealand Army, where he taught general military history from Alexander the Great to the Balkan War, and at the Command and Staff College of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, where he taught airpower history and doctrine and supervised advanced research in military history.
Hayward has repudiated his thesis, but Holocaust deniers continued to cite the thesis as evidence of academic support for their positions.
