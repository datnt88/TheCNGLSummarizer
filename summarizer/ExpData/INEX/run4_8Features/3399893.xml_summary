Aside from the modified car drivers found at cruises there are several other groups which can be found at most cruises.
Cruising and modifying have long been represented in the commercial magazines Max Power, Fast Car Magazine and Redline, which review the latest cars, modifying products, cruises and feature modified cars and other lifestyle articles.
Max Power is so synonymous with cruising and modifying that an outrageously styled modified car is often referred to as a "Max Power" car.
