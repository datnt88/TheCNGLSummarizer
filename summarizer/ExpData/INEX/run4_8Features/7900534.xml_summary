The Glaspalast (Glass Palace) was a glass and iron exhibition building in Munich modeled after The Crystal Palace in London.
The Glaspalast opened for the Erste Allgemeine Deutsche Industrieausstellung (First General German Industrial Exhibition) on July 15, 1854.
The Erste Allgemeine Deutsche Industrieausstellung was opened five weeks later, only three years after the completion of the Crystal Palace in London, which served as model.
