Human sex determination refers to the processes by which an individual becomes either a male or female during development.
However, Dr. MS Palmer later discovered a ZFY analogue on the X chromosome, providing evidence that ZFY was in fact not the TDF. Eventually, Dr. Peter Koopman was able to prove that the SRY gene is the TDF from studies on XX males..
While gonad development is a result of the presence or absence of the sex determination gene SRY on the Y chromosome, sex differentiation is determined by the hormonal products produced by the gonads.
