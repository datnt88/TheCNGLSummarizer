Since the termination of the Chevrolet Caprice product, most police departments currently use the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor as the standard patrol car.
There are many jurisdictions that use the Chevrolet Impala, which in its current configuration is a front wheel drive V6.  The Dodge Charger (LX) and Dodge Magnum are the most likely challengers to the Crown Victoria as a RWD V8 patrol car, though the Washington State Patrol and the North Carolina Highway Patrol are using the vehicle initially as an unmarked patrol car.
The side doors and sometimes the hood of a marked police car usually bear the agency's badge or the city seal, often in reflective finish.
