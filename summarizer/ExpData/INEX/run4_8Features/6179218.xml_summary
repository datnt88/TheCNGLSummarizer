Most popular in this category are 1:18 scale diecast automobile replicas.
During the infancy of the 1:18 scale, Ertl and Revell were 2 of the few manufacturers selling a limited number of diecast models of cars, mostly older American models (although Revell Germany sold a number of diecast German and American models).
Often, cars featured in collectible car magazines (such as Collectible Automobile) were soon the subjects of 1:18 diecast models.
