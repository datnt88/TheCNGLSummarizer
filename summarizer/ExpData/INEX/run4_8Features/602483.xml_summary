Weyland-Yutani is a fictional corporation in the motion picture Alien and its sequels, often referred to simply as "The Company".
At no time in Alien nor in the portfolio was the name of the Company spelled with a D. This was changed by the time of Aliens to "Weyland-Yutani."
In the Special Edition release of Alien Resurrection The character of Dr. Wren (played by J.E. Freeman) states Weyland-Yutani had been brought out by Wal-Mart decades before the start of The film.
