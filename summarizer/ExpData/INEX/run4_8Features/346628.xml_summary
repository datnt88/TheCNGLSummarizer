Ph.D. entrance requirements in the higher ranked schools typically require a student to have a master's degree by research, or a master's with a significant research component.
There has been some debate over the acceptance of a three-year honours degree (as in the case of graduates from British universities) as equivalent entry requirement to graduate research programmes (M.Phil., Ph.D.) in Australian universities, even though British graduates hold equivalent honours classification (upper-second and above).
Michigan leads in terms of progressive policy regarding graduate student unions, and four graduate schools in Michigan currently recognize graduate employee unions: the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State University, and Western Michigan University.
