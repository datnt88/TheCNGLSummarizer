Doorman Perdomo shouted at Chapman, "Do you know what you've done?", to which Chapman calmly replied, "Yes, I just shot John Lennon." The first policemen to arrive were Steve Spiro and Peter Cullen, who were at 72nd Street and Broadway when they heard a report of shots fired at the Dakota.
According to another account, Lennon quietly said his whispering last words, "Yes, I'm John Lennon," before slipping into his final coma.
In 2000, the John Lennon Museum was opened at the Saitama Super Arena in Saitama, Saitama, Japan and Liverpool renamed its airport to Liverpool John Lennon Airport and adopted the motto "Above us only sky" in 2002.
