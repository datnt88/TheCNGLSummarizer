Antoine Jérôme Balard (30 September 1802 - 30 April 1876) was a French chemist and the discoverer of bromine.
This achievement brought him the reputation that secured his election as successor to L.J. Thenard in the chair of chemistry at the faculty of sciences in Paris, and in 1851 he was appointed professor of chemistry at the College de France, where he had M.P.E. Berthelot first as pupil, then as assistant and finally as colleague.
Balard also had Louis Pasteur as a pupil when Pasteur was only 26 years old.
