Mount Okmok is the highest point on the rim of Okmok Caldera (Unmagim Anatuu in Aleut) on the northeastern part of Umnak Island in the eastern Aleutian Islands of Alaska, USA. This 5.8 mile (9.3 km) wide circular caldera truncates the top of a large shield volcano.
On Saturday, July 12, 2008, Okmok Caldera exploded without warning, sending a plume of ash over 33,000 feet (10,000 m) into the air.
The Alaska Volcano Observatory issued an advisory stating ash in the Dutch Harbor area poses a threat to aircraft.
