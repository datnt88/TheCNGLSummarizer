The simplest pattern in pattern matching is an explicit value or a variable.
However, it is possible to perform some string pattern matching within the same framework that has been discussed throughout this article.
Early programming languages with pattern matching constructs include SNOBOL from 1962, SASL from 1976, NPL from 1977, and KRC from 1981.
