An eruption column consists of hot volcanic ash emitted during an explosive volcanic eruption.
Eruption column heights are a useful way of measuring eruption intensity since for a given atmospheric temperature, the column height is proportional to the fourth power of the mass eruption rate.
Following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, aircraft were diverted to avoid the eruption column, but nonetheless, ash dispersing over a wide area caused damage to 16 aircraft, some as far as 1000Â km from the volcano.
