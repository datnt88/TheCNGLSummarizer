The Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) is a large-area, high efficiency neutron detector that is used in basic research of rare isotopes at Michigan State University's National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), a nuclear physics research facility.
When the NSCL upgraded their capabilities to the Coupled Cyclotron facility, a Florida State University/Michigan State University consortium built the Sweeper magnet to be used with two existing neutron walls to perform neutronâ€“fragment coincidence experiments.
The MoNA project is a collaboration between ten colleges and universities that originally constructed the highly efficient large-area neutron detector for the detection of high-energy neutrons to be used in experiments with fast rare isotopes at the NSCL. The project is funded by the National Science Foundation.
