Many diverse activities depend on electron cyclotron resonance technology, including
The ECR ion source makes use of the Electron Cyclotron Resonance to heat a plasma.
Some of these industrial fields would not even exist without the use of this fundamental technology, which makes electron cyclotron resonance ion and plasma sources one of the enabling technologies of today's world.
