Otago Harbour is the natural harbour of Dunedin, New Zealand, consisting of a long, much-indented stretch of generally navigable water separating Otago Peninsula from the mainland.
A significant area at the head of the harbour has been reclaimed since the founding of Dunedin, primarily for industrial use.
This continued until the Scottish settlers arrived in 1848 and made Port Chalmers and Dunedin the new centres on the harbour.
