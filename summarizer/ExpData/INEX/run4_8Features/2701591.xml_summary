In spite of the ideal of moderation, consumption of alcohol was often high.
However, in 1690, England passed "An Act for the Encouraging of the Distillation of Brandy and Spirits from Corn" and within four years the annual production of distilled spirits, most of which was gin, reached nearly one million gallons..
And not only would it be enough to prevent drunkenness; any consumption of alcohol would come to be seen as unacceptable.
