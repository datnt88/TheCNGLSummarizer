Herma (Greek for bond or foundation, and germ or embryo) is a piece for solo piano composed by Iannis Xenakis in 1961.
It is based on a formulation of the algebraic equations of Boolean algebra, and is also a prime example of what Xenakis called symbolic music.
Boolean algebra is the main mathematical principle behind Herma (Chung 2003, 33).
