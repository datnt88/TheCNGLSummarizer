The EURion constellation is a pattern of symbols found on a number of banknote designs since about 1996.
The EURion constellation is most prominent and was therefore first recognised on the 10 euro banknote.
However, experiments by Steven J. Murdoch and others showed that this banknote detection code does not rely on the EURion pattern.
