New York Crystal Palace was an exhibition building constructed for the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations in New York City in 1853.
The building was directly inspired by The Crystal Palace built in London's Hyde Park to house the Great Exhibition of 1851.
The New York Crystal Palace was crowned by a dome 100 feet in diameter and, like the original Crystal Palace, was constructed from iron and glass.
