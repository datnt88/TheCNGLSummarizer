The beach is a popular site for the Hooker's Sea Lion, Phocarctos hookeri, to bask on the sand.
The bay is often thought by locals to have been named for a small biting insect known as the sandfly, but this is incorrect.
A small island which lies at the northeastern end of the bay is known as Lion Rock or Lion's Head Rock, due to its shape.
