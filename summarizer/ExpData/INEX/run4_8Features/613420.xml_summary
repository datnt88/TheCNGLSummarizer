According to the Atkin's diet, the low carbohydrate content of pork rinds makes them more nutritious than some low-fat snack foods, such as high-carbohydrate, fat-free pretzels.
Scrunchions is a Newfoundland term for small pieces of pork rind or pork fat-back fried until rendered and crispy.
In the United Kingdom, pork scratchings (though not crackling â€” see above) are sold as a snack food in the same way pork rinds are in the USA. Unlike the physically large, but relatively light bags of 'deep fried skin without the fat' sold around the world, in the UK they are sold in relatively small bags which usually weigh between 42g and 90g.
