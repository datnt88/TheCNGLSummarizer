The settlement of Otakou lies within the boundaries of the city of Dunedin, New Zealand.
In its original form 'Otago' it was the name of the channel off Wellers Rock but was transferred to the lower harbour as a whole, the port, the nearby MƒÅori settlements and the Weller brothers' whaling establishment - one of the region's oldest European settlements, having been founded in 1831.
Otakou was probably also the "city of Otago" burnt by Captain Kelly in December 1817 during the Sofia incident.
