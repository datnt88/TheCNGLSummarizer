He administered the ranch until 1871, when he accepted an invitation from his brother Henry M. Keith to help build a railroad in the Central American nation of Costa Rica.
By 1882, the Costa Rican government had defaulted on its payments to Keith and could no longer meet its obligations to the London banks from which it had borrowed to pay for the railroad.
These terms were made official in a document signed by Keith and cabinet minister Bernardo Soto Alfaro on April 21, 1884 (known to Costa Rican historians as the "Soto-Keith contract").
