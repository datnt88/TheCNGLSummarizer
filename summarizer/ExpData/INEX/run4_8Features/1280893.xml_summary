A cooking apple is an apple that is used primarily for cooking rather than eating fresh.
Other variety such as Bramley or Golden Noble are cut into small segments for pies, tarts etc. Bramley is by far the most popular cooking apple in the UK, as it grows easily to a large size, keeps well and cooks well.
Often people have cooking apple trees and are swamped with apples in September.
