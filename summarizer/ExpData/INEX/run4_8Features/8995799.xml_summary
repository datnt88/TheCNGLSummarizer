The only actor from the Alien films to appear in one of the prequels was Lance Henriksen, who had played the android Bishop in Aliens and a man claiming to be the android's creator in Alien 3. Henriksen returned for Alien vs. Predator, in which he played Charles Bishop Weyland.
The Alien was eventually killed when Ripley blew it into the vacuum of space and propelled it away from the Narcissus using the craft's engines.
He also explains to Ripley why they call Aaron "85." He was killed by the Alien during the "bait and chase" plan to trap it in the furnace.
