"The Seinfeld Chronicles" (also known as "Good News, Bad News" for syndication) is the pilot episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld.
However, the production staff and writers refer to the pilot as The Seinfeld Chronicles, to avoid confusion with a later Seinfeld episode called "The Pilot".
Jerry's calling Kramer "Kessler" is explained in "The Betrayal", the "backwards episode" in season 9.  This features a scene from 11Â years in the past, in which Jerry moves into his new apartment.
