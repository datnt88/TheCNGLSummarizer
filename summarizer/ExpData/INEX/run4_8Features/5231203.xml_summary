George Toogood Smith (1903â€“5 June 1955) was the maternal uncle, through marriage, of John Lennon.
Smith told Lennon that words did not have to be taken at face value, as they had many different meanings, which Lennon would later use in his writing.
Lennon would later meet Paul McCartney for the first time at St. Peter's Church, where Smith was buried.
