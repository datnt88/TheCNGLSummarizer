A repetitive strain injury (RSI), also called cumulative trauma disorder (CTD), occupational overuse syndrome, or work related upper limb disorder (WRULD), is any of a loose group of conditions resulting from overuse of a tool, such as a computer keyboard or musical instrument or other activity that requires repeated movements.
The most well known injury is Carpal tunnel syndrome, which is common among guitarists as well as assembly line workers but relatively rare among computer users: computer-related arm pain is generally caused by another specific condition.
Self-massage products like the Armaid have been developed specifically to target areas typically affected by RSI. Active release techniques are effective in reducing RSI symptoms by releasing the tension of the muscles and nerves of the injured area.
