Syagrius preserved his father's rump state between the Somme and the Loire around Soissons after the collapse of central rule in the Western Empire, the so-called "Kingdom" of Syagrius, as Gregory of Tours understood it, applying the Frankish term for an independent leader, rather than a Roman term, or merely dux of the Gallo-Romans.
Syagrius governed this Gallo-Roman enclave from the death of his father in 464 until 486, when whatever remained of Roman Gaul was overrun by the territorial expansion of the Frankish kingdom of Clovis I.
His regime represented the last recorded instance of native Gallo-Roman authority in Gaul; in fact he was known to the Germanic barbarians as the "King of the Romans".
