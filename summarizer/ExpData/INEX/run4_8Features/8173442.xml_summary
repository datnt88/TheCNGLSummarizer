Xwrits periodically locks the X Window System while a brightly-colored hand, alternately clenching and stretching as if in pain, is displayed to remind the user to take a break.
It reminds the user to take a 5-minute break after every 55 minutes of typing.
Instead of just reminding the user to take a break, it locks the screen so that the user cannot use the keyboard or mouse until 20 seconds have elapsed.
