Paper Mario, known in Japan as Mario Story (マリオストーリー, Mario Sutōrī) is a role-playing (RPG) video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64.
Paper Mario was re-released on the Virtual Console in 2007; the game was also released for the iQue Player.
The game has often been compared to the previous Mario RPG title, . Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell judged that "Paper Mario is a vastly superior game to SMRPG", while IGN compared the game's simple plot unfavourably with the SNES game and RPGFan claimed that some of Paper Mario's story was copied from it.
