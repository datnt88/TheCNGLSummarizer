Cynthia Lennon (née Powell) (born 10 September 1939 in Blackpool, Lancashire, England) is the former wife of John Lennon.
Cynthia married Lennon the next day.
Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon) but Lennon accused Cynthia of an affair in India—saying that she was no "innocent little flower".
