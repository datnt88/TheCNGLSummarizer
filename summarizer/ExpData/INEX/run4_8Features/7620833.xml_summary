The Optimal Diet (or Optimal Nutrition) is a high fat, low carbohydrate diet developed by Polish doctor Jan Kwasniewski.
The Optimal Diet has been used in Poland since the 1970s, but has gained a broader popularity the last decade with the publication of several books by Dr. Kwasniewski.
According to Kwasniewski, the energy requirement on the Optimal Diet is about 25-40% less than on the average diet.
