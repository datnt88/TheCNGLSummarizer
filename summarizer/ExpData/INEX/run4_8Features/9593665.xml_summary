Liverpool Software Gazette was a short-lived computer magazine published by Bruce Everiss' Microdigital company who were based in Liverpool, UK.
There were some regular columns such as Pets Corner (for the Commodore PET), Apple Pips (for the Apple II), Nascom Notes and Nybbles (small BASIC tips and routines).
The work illustrated was funded by a small RIBA (The Royal Institute of British Architects) grant for teaching architecture using computers.
