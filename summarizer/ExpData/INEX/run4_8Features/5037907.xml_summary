The Crown Victoria Police Interceptor (often referred to simply as CVPI or P71) is the law enforcement version of the Ford Crown Victoria.
From 1993â€“1998, the police car models of Crown Victorias were officially known as Crown Victoria P71s. The current major facelift of the car was introduced in 1998.
There are few notable differences between the Police Interceptor and standard Crown Victoria.
