Saint Agnes of Bohemia (Czech: Svatá Anežka Česká), or Agnes of Prague (1211-March 6, 1282), was a medieval Bohemian princess who opted for a life of charity and piety over a life of luxury and comfort.
After Boleslav died, Agnes returned to Prague at the age of six.
The wedding of Agnes and Henry was cancelled after six years of engagement.
