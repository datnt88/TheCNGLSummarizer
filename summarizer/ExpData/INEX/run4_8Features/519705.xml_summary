In January 1880 Molien entered the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Tartu (in German Kaiserliche Universit√§t Dorpat) as a student of astronomy.
The obtained results he submitted to the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Tartu as a master thesis titled "Ueber die lineare Transformation der elliptischen Functionen".
Since the University of Tartu had only one professorship in pure mathematics, Molien had to stay for years at docent's position.
