Cyprus and Malta will not print euro notes for the time being, and will use previously issued banknotes from other eurozone member states.
However, country codes have been reserved for both countries, as appears on the ECB Euro banknote FAQ site [https://www.ecb.eu/bc/faqbc/design/html/index.en.html#q10].
The initial design of the Euro with the 2002 signature of Wim Duisenberg, has been issued in each of the 7 denominations by each of the NCBs of Finland, Portugal, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Ireland, France, Spain, Germany, Greece and Belgium, with the exception of the €200 and €500 banknotes from Portugal and the €200 banknote from Ireland.
