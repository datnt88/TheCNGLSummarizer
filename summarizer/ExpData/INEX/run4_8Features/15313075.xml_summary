The Estonian 100 Krooni bill (100 EEK) is a denomination of the Estonian currency.
Lydia Koidula, who was an Estonian poetess and playwrigh (1843-1886), is featured on the front side of the bill, which is why the 100 Krooni bill is often called a "Koidula".
The 100 Krooni bill is one of the primary banknotes (and in most cases, the main banknotes to be used in everyday shopping) dispensed by ATMs in Estonia as well as the primary bill used for withdrawals or cashing checks.
