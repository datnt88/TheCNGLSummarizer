The Macintosh 128K was severely limited by a lack of upgrades.
In fact due to the lack of memory, Apple intentionally chose to exclude the 128K from three of its most important early developments, effectively orphaning it from the rest of the Macintosh family: The Hard Disk 20 (Apple's first hard drive for the Macintosh), 800K floppy disk drive and  AppleShare (Apple's built-in networking file sharing technology), all of which required the Hierarchical File System introduced in September 1985, which the 128K could not use with its limited RAM. This made it more of an appliance than the rest of the Macintosh series, to the chagrin of many customers who expected a well-rounded entry-level computer.
Additionally, Apple offered an 800K floppy disk drive kit, including updated 128K ROMs, which required the 512K logic board upgrade, resulting in a Macintosh 512Ke.
