The 1960s version of the group included Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford, and for a brief stint, Norman Fell.
Marilyn Monroe, Angie Dickinson, Juliet Prowse, and Shirley MacLaine were often referred to as the "Rat Pack Mascots", a title which reportedly made these ladies feel like "one of the boys".
"Brian Sings and Swings", the Frank Sinatra, Jr./Brian Griffin/Stewie Griffin ensemble is called "The New Rat Pack", in homage to the original group.
