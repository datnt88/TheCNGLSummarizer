Bloecher became interested in UFOs during the wave of sightings across the U.S. in 1952.
In the 1970s, Bloecher was associated with MUFON and CUFOS. In 1975, he co-investigated a series of UFO abduction reports with Budd Hopkins.
In the early 1980s, Bloecher retired from ufology, donating his files to CUFOS.
