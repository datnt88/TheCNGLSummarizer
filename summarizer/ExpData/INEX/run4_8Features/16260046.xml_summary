Not to be confused with Norton Editor, see Peter Norton Computing
ne (for "nice editor") is a console text editor for POSIX computer operating systems such as Linux or Mac OS X. It uses termcap library, or a library such as ncurses which provides that interface.
ne was originally developed on the Amiga and inspired by that platform's TurboText editor, which was written by Martin Taillefer.
