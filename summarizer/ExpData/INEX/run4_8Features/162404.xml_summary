A stratovolcano, also called a composite volcano, is a tall, conical volcano composed of many layers of hardened lava, tephra, and volcanic ash.
Subduction-zone stratovolcanoes like Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo typically erupt with explosive force, because the magma is too stiff to allow easy escape of volcanic gases.
In March-April 1982, three explosive eruptions of El Chich√≥n Volcano in the State of Chiapas, southeastern Mexico, caused the worst volcanic disaster in that country's history.
