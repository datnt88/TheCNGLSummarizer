A smaller, but important loss of arable land arises from the lack of renewal of rich flooding sediment due to flood control works.
A large part of the arable land on earth is around the largest rivers on earth; for example, the Nile River, the Mississippi River, the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, the Yellow River, the Amazon River, the Ganges and the Rhine River.
However, non-arable land can be converted into arable land.
