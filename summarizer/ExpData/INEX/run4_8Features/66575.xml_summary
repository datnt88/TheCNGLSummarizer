A nutrient is food or chemicals that an organism needs to live and grow or a substance used in an organism's metabolism which must be taken in from its environment.
A nutrient is essential to an organism if it cannot be synthesized by the organism in sufficient quantities and must be obtained from an external source.
Oxygen and water are also essential for human survival, but are generally not considered "food" when consumed in isolation.
