Based on the Audi Pikes Peak quattro concept car, the Q7 is designed more for on-road use, and was not meant for serious off-road use where a transfer case is needed.
To underline the racing success of its diesel engined Le Mans-winning R10 racer, Audi presented a concept-version of the car with a new V12 TDI Q7 at the 2006 Paris Auto Show.
Audi presented the Audi Q7 Hybrid at the Hanover Motor Show.
