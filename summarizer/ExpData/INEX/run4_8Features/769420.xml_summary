Black Sigatoka is a leaf spot disease of banana plants caused by ascomycete fungusMycosphaerella fijiensis Morelet.
Black Sigatoka, also known as black leaf streak, was named for its similarities with the Yellow Sigatoka caused by Mycosphaerella musicola Mulder, after the Sigatoka valley in Fiji where an outbreak of this disease reached epidemic proportions from 1912 to 1923.
In commercial export plantations, Black Sigatoka is controlled by  frequent applications of fungicides.
