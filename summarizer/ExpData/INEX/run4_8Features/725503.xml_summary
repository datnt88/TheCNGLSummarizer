Road &amp; Track magazine considered the Valiant to be "one of the best all-around domestic cars."
The Valiant was its own marque and advertised as the Valiant by Chrysler Corp with the tagline 'Nobody's kid brother, this one stands on its own four tires.' Starting in 1961, the Valiant was marketed in the US as a Plymouth model.
In other markets such as Canada and South Africa, where Valiant was a marque in its own right, the car remained known as Valiant Barracuda until the A-body Barracuda was discontinued after 1969.
