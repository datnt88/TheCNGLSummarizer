The Lives of John Lennon is a 1988 biography of musician John Lennon by Americanauthor Albert Goldman.
Despite the damning from Goldman in the book, Lennon comes across much better than Yoko Ono, for whom Goldman shows unbridled contempt.
Despite Goldman's praise of him in the book, Paul McCartney did not return the favour, and condemned Goldman's account of his old bandmate, telling fans and the press "Look, don't buy it." Singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson, whose friendship with Lennon peaked during his 1974 separation from Ono, told Rolling Stone that Goldman "got me drunk" while interviewing him, probing Nilsson for 'dirt' about Lennon, and Nilsson wouldn't cooperate. (Nilsson gets a chapter in the book, "Harry the Hustler", which credits him with having better confidence-man skills than singing talent.)
