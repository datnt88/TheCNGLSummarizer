Aspic is a dish in which ingredients are set into a gelatine made from  a meat stock or consomm√©.
The aspic may need additional gelatin in order to set properly.
Since fish gelatin melts at a lower temperature than gelatins of other meats, fish aspic is more delicate and melts more readily in the mouth.
