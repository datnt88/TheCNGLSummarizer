The name of the beautiful Sleeping Beauty is "Princess Aurora" (Latin for "dawn"), in this film, as it was in the original Tchaikovsky ballet; this name occurred in Perrault's version, not as the princess's name, but as her daughter's.
Princess Aurora, Prince Phillip, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather were featured as guests in  Disney's House of Mouse, and Maleficent was one of the villains in Mickey's House of Villains'.
Princess Aurora (and, to a lesser extent, Prince Phillip, the three good fairies, and Maleficent) makes regular appearances in the parks and parades.
