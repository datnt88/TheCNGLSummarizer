Similar to its predecessor "Seoul Bus Card", T-money can be used to pay for bus, subway and some taxi fares.
Some stores and attractions including Lotte World amusement park, Kyobo Book Centre, GS 25 and other selected convenience stores accept T-money as cash.
You need proper ID such as a Youth Card or Student ID in order to purchase these cards.
