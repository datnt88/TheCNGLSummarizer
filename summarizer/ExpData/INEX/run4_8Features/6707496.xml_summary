Pac-Mania contains several new features and significant differences from its original counterpart.
The game takes place in four environments: "Block Town" (made up of Lego-like building blocks), "Pac-Man Theatre" (a 3D version of the original Pac-Man maze), "Sandbox Land" (walls are made up of pyramids), and "Jungly Steps" (appearing as pathways with no railings, resembling a set of steps that rise toward the back of the maze).
An accurate arcade emulation of the North American version of Pac-Mania appears on Namco Museum 50th Anniversary, the Game Boy Advance's Pac-Man Collection, 128-bit Namco Museum, and Namco Museum Vol. 5 for Playstation.
