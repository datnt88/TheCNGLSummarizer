For information on the dietary practices of Paleolithic humans, see Paleolithic#Diet and nutrition.
The dietary regimen known as the Paleolithic diet (abbreviated paleo diet or paleodiet), also popularly called the caveman diet, Stone Age diet and hunter-gatherer diet, is a modern nutritional approach which seeks to mimic the ancient diet of wild plants and animals that various human (Homo) species habitually consumed during the Paleolithic, a period of about 2.5 million years duration that ended around 10,000 years ago with the development of agriculture—this ancestral diet is also commonly referred to as the "Paleolithic diet".
The Paleolithic diet is a modern dietary regimen that seeks to mimic the diet of preagricultural hunter-gatherers, one that corresponds to what was available in any of the ecological niches of Paleolithic humans.
