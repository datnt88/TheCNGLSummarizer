An herbal tea, tisane, or ptisan is an herbal infusion made from anything other than the leaves of the tea bush (Camellia sinensis).
In some countries (but not in the United States) the use of the word tea is legally  restricted to infusions of Camellia sinensis (the tea plant).
Many companies produce herbal tea bags for such infusions.
