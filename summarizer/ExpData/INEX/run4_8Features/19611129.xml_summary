Sleepy People should not be confused with the Oregonian New Wave indie rock band The Sleepy People or Californian progressive rock band Sleeping People.
Sleepy People formed around a line-up of Tiny Wood (lead vocals), Paul Hope (guitar, backing vocals), Rachel Theresa (flute, backing vocals), Richard Green (bass), Kerry Harrison (drums) and Liz Wardby (keyboards), and established themselves in a run-down house in Jesmond, Newcastle which they called “Sleepy Hall”.
The band’s initial line-up was identical to the last Sleepy People line-up - Mark Dunphy (lead vocals), Paul Hope (guitar, backing vocals), Rachel Theresa (flute, backing vocals), Tom Evans (bass), Graeme Swaddle (drums) and Anna Blaydon (keyboards).
