Tenosynovitis is the inflammation of the fluid-filled sheath (called the synovium) that surrounds a tendon.
Symptoms of tenosynovitis include pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the particular joint where the inflammation occurs.
The health care provider may touch or stretch the tendon or have you move the muscle to which it is attached to see whether you experience pain.
