Oamaru ( (·)), the largest town in North Otago, in the South Island of New Zealand, also functions as the main town in the Waitaki District.
Those at the Waitaki River mouth and at Awamoa both date from the Archaic (Moa-hunter) phase of Māori culture, when the most populated area of New Zealand clustered along the south-east coast from about 1100 AD. The Waitaki River mouth housed at least 1,200 ovens.
More European settlers arrived in the Oamaru area in the 1850s.
