A second-generation prototype two-detector HIDAC-PET camera was assessed at the MRC Cyclotron Unit, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK, during 1999.
The first was purchased by Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, UK and is installed at their newly established MRI/vPET Imaging Centre at Hammersmith Hospital, and the second camera was purchased by the Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland and has been relocated in 2005 to ETH, Hoenngerberg, Zurich.
Quad-HIDAC cameras have also been used at Leeds General Infirmary, UK, for arthritis research and at the Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK for oncological investigations.
