Clone Bricks are imitation LEGO Bricks, such as Mega Bloks, Tyco bricks, and others.
The Lego Group has sought to put an end to clone bricks and retain sole manufacturing rights over the Lego Indicia.
A trial court found many Coko bricks to be infringing; Coko was ordered to cease manufacture of the infringing bricks, publish a formal apology in the Beijing Daily, and pay a small fee in damages to Interlego.
