The coca leaf is listed on Schedule I of the 1961 Single Convention together with cocaine and heroin.
Outside of South America, most countries' laws make no distinction between the coca leaf and any other substance containing cocaine, so the possession of coca leaf (except for de-cocainized leaf) is prohibited.
In the Netherlands, coca leaf is legally in the same category as cocaine, both are List I drugs of the Opium Law.
