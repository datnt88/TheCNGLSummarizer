General Ashraf Rashid (Urdu: أشرف رشيد) (May 23 1948 – October 2 2004) was a Pakistani general and the former head of the Special Service Group division within the Pakistan Army from October 1995 to September 1999.
He served in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 (during which he was premanently injured on the right cheek) and, later, in the Kargil War, the failure of which he was widely blamed for.
Before becoming Commander of the Special Service Group commando division, Rashid was Director General of Military Operations, succeeding Jehangir Karamat, who became Chief of Army Staff.
