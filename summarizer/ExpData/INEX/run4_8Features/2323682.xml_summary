Other types of Goombas have appeared throughout the Mario series, although these largely vary from game to game.
In The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! and The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 by DIC Entertainment, Hammer Bros. make sparse appearances as antagonists.
Although usually generic enemies in games, some appearances feature Wigglers, usually gigantic in size, as boss characters, such as in Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine and Super Princess Peach.
