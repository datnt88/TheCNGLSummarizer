During Roman times, a road linked Fécamp to Étretat, passing through the present-day village of Fond-Pitron.
The history of Fécamp has always revolved around the fishing industry and its harbour (first mentioned in the 11th century).
Throughout the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, Fécamp had an important role as the chief fishing port in France for cod and cod-related fish.
