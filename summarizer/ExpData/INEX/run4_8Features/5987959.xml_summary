Julia Stanley Lennon (née Stanley) (12 March 1914 – 15 July 1958) was the mother of John Lennon.
Lennon chose Alf (twice) and then Julia walked away, but in the end Lennon (crying) followed her.
Alf took Lennon to his brother Sydney's house, in the Liverpool suburb of Maghull, a few months before Julia came to term.
