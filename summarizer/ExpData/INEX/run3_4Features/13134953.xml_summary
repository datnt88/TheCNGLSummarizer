Zajdi, zajdi, jasno sonce (O Set, O Set, Clear Sun; Macedonian: Зајди, зајди, јасно сонце; Bulgarian: Зайди, зайди, ясно слънце) is a popular Macedonian and  Bulgarian song which has in recent times gained popularity throughout the Balkans.
According to folklorist Nikolai Kaufman, who finds the melody identical to that of an earlier Karavelov song, it is based on a Bulgarian folk song.
Professor Georgi Kraev, on the other hand, views it as more of Balkan song, originally popularised in Bulgaria and only later in the rest of the peninsula.
