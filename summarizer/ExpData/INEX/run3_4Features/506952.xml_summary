The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, sometimes known as the First Kashmir War, was fought between India and Pakistan over the region of Kashmir from 1947 to 1948.
The result of the war still affects the geopolitics of both the countries.
With Indian reinforcements the Pakistani / AZK offensive ran out of steam towards the end of 1947.
