Chondromalacia Patella (also known as CMP, Patello-femoral Pain Syndrome, or Runner's Knee) is a term for a large and disparate group of medical conditions that can cause pain at the front of the knee.
A radiologist might, for example, note chondromalacia on an MRI of an ankle.
The treatment will depend on the specific source of a person's pain.
