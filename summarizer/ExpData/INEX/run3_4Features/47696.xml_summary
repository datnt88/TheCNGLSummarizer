A sport utility vehicle (SUV) is a generic marketing description for a rugged automotive vehicle similar to a station wagon but built on a light-truck chassis.
Compact SUVs and mini SUVs may have five or fewer seats, especially if they are based on a car platform instead of a light truck.
The Australian "utility" or "ute" (an abbreviation of "coupe utility", a vehicle type created in Australia in 1934) traditionally refers to a car-based commercial vehicle with an open load area at the rear.
