A cruise is a meeting of car enthusiasts at a predetermined location, organised predominantly through the internet (in recent times) but also largely through mobile phone, word of mouth or simply by a cruise being established enough that it becomes a regular event.
Regardless of the type of cruise the events that take place are similar, cars park up or cruise (drive slowly) around the car park while people socialise, often meeting people from cruise websites, show off their cars and admire other people's cars.
Max Power is so synonymous with cruising and modifying that an outrageously styled modified car is often referred to as a "Max Power" car.
