The growers of coca are named Cocaleros and part of the coca production for traditional use is legal in Peru, Bolivia and Chile.
With the growth of the Colombian drug cartels in the 1980s, coca leaf became a valuable agricultural commodity, particularly in Peru and Bolivia, where the quality of coca is higher than in Colombia.
The bottom line is that crop eradication - whether coca bush or poppy crop - can only be successful when economic alternatives are readily available for coca or poppy farmers to fall back on.
