Jean-Joseph Surin (February 9, 1600, Bordeauxâ€”April 21, 1665, Bordeaux) was a French Jesuit mystic, preacher, devotional writer and exorcist.
Surin was reared in a cloister.
It was during these rites that the nuns accused Grandier of being in league with the devil and initiating their demonic possession.
