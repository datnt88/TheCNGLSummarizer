The film is the forty-fifth animated feature in the Disney animated features canon, and was named after the popular country song "Home on the Range".
Prior to the film's release, Disney stated that it would be their last film in their animated features canon to use traditional animation.
However, the film was universally praised for Alan Menken's return to Disney animated features.
