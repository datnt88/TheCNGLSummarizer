Liverpool Software Gazette was a short-lived computer magazine published by Bruce Everiss' Microdigital company who were based in Liverpool, UK.
There were some regular columns such as Pets Corner (for the Commodore PET), Apple Pips (for the Apple II), Nascom Notes and Nybbles (small BASIC tips and routines).
One small program, Star Gate, written in Apple II BASIC and published in the fourth edition even became the basis for a complete astronomy program known as Celestia (available from http://www.shatters.net/celestia/).
