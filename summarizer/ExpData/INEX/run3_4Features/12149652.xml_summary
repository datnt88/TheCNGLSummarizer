To date she is the first cinematic Bond girl to officially marry secret agent Commander James Bond, though Bond would later marry again (though the second marriage was invalid) in John Gardner's Scorpius.
In return, Bond continued to see Tracy and eventually fell in love with her.
She was the first and so far, only, Bond girl  to ever marry James Bond (Kissy Suzuki and Anya Amasova have otherwise posed as his wives), as well as being one of the few Bond girls with whom it was strongly suggested that Bond was actually in love.
