The James Bond film series are spy films inspired by Ian Fleming's novels about the fictional MI6 agent Commander James Bond (codename 007).
For the first time in a Bond film there is something that could be called emotion.” And another, “Bond is back with a bang.”
Thus, the 21st Bond film, Casino Royale (2006), in addition to being the first film adaptation of a Fleming novel since 1979's Moonraker, was to be a reboot of the franchise, establishing a new timeline and narrative framework not meant to precede any previous film.
