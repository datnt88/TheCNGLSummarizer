Put another way, a chemical element cannot be transformed into other chemical elements by chemical processes.
Later chemical elements were also assigned unique chemical symbols, based on the name of the element, but not necessarily in English.
The first transuranium element (element with atomic number greater than 92) discovered was neptunium in 1940.
