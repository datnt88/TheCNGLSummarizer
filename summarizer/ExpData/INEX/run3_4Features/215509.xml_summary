The high protein and low-carbohydrate diet recommended by Loren Cordain and colleagues—i.e. about 56–65% of food energy coming from animal foods and 36–45% from plant foods, with 19–35% of energy derived from protein, 22–40% from carbohydrates and 28–58% from fat—based on the dietary patterns of worldwide modern-day hunter-gatherers has attracted a number of criticisms, including the following:
Wolfgang Kopp states that "carbohydrate food, consumed by hunter-gatherers, is high in fiber and low-glycemic in effect, eliciting small amounts of insulin only. [...]
However, it is the question, whether diets high in low-glycemic plant food (which is relatively high in indigestible fiber and relatively low in carbohydrate) should be labeled as “high-carbohydrate” diets." Kopp also says that it is very likely that diets with only a moderately increased glycemic load are atherogenic to some degree, referencing Coutinho et al. (1999) and Kopp (2006).
