Lance Bishop 341-B, portrayed by Lance Henriksen, is a character from the science fiction films Aliens (1986) and Alien 3 (1992).
Ripley believes him to be another android; Bishop II claims to be the man who designed the Bishop series, sent by the company to show Ripley "a friendly face."  Mr. Aaron (Ralph Brown) attacks Bishop II with a monkey wrench, calling him a "fucking android".
The portrayal of androids in the Alien series — Ash in Alien, Bishop in Aliens and Alien 3, and Call (Winona Ryder) in Alien Resurrection (1997) — has been studied for its implications relating to how humans deal with the presence of an "Other", as Ripley treats them with fear and suspicion, and a form of "hi-tech racism and android apartheid" is present throughout the series.
