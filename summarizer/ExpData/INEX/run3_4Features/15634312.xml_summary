The Puff model is a volcanic ash tracking model developed at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Puff was initially conceived and developed by Prof. H. Tanaka as a novel method for simulating ash cloud trajectories during the eruption of Mt. Redoubt, 1989.
Puff is now in use at AVO, Anchorage Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC), AFWA, and other national agencies worldwide as well as at other universities.
