Alcohol advertising is the promotion of alcoholic beverages by alcohol producers through a variety of media.
The European Union and World Health Organization (WHO) have both specified that the advertising and promotion of alcohol needs to be controlled.
Advertising cannot promote brands based on alcohol content or its effects.
