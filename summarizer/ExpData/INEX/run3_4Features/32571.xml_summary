For other uses, see Volcano (disambiguation).
Vents that issue volcanic material (lava, which is what magma is called once it has escaped to the surface, and ash) and gases (mainly steam and magmatic gases) can be located anywhere on the landform.
The concentrations of different volcanic gases can vary considerably from one volcano to the next.
