"The Stock Tip" is the fifth episode of the first season of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld.
He then reads the business section of the newspaper to see what happened to the stock since he got out of it.
The prior shows went with one overriding plot, but "Tip" indulges equally in the stock and Vanessa elements.
