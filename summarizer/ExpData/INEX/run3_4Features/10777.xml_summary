Friedrich Wöhler (31 July 1800 - 23 September 1882) was a German chemist, best-known for his synthesis of urea, but also the first to isolate several of the elements.
Wöhler was also known for being a co-discoverer of beryllium and silicon, as well as the synthesis of calcium carbide, among others.
They proved bytheir experiments that a group of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms can behave like an element, take the place of an element, and can be exchanged for elements in chemical compounds.
