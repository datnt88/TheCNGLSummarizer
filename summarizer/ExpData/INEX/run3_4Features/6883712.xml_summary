The Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway was built by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway to serve the Crystal Palace after it was moved to Crystal Palace from its original site in Hyde Park.
Following the destruction of the Crystal Palace by fire in 1936, the line lost most of original function of carrying visitors to events in the Palace.
In the early 1990s, a local amenity group, Friends of the Great North Wood produced a walking leaflet titled From the Nun's Head to the Screaming Alice along a route that closely follows the former railway line. ('Screaming Alice' was Cockney rhyming slang for Crystal Palace.) The walk continues from the line's terminus at Crystal Palace High Level Station, past the Crystal Palace Museum, and on to the existing Crystal Palace railway station.
