Full-size Ford is the popular term for a long-running line of Ford vehicles which have been produced in North America with a large degree of similarity since the Model T in 1908, up to the current Crown Victoria.
Likewise, the Ford Zephyr and other internationally-produced big Fords have major mechanical and cultural differences from the American full-size lineage.
If the Ford full-size line were to be taken as a continuous automotive line, it would comfortably be the longest in the car industry, with staggering collective production numbers.
