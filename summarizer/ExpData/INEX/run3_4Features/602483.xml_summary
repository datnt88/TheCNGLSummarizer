At no time in Alien nor in the portfolio was the name of the Company spelled with a D. This was changed by the time of Aliens to "Weyland-Yutani."
The original Weyland-Yutani logo was an Egyptian winged-sun emblem; it was modified to its current corporo-industrial interlocked W/Y for Aliens.
The name "Weyland-Yutani" was created by Ron Cobb, one of the designers of the Nostromo and her crew's uniforms.
