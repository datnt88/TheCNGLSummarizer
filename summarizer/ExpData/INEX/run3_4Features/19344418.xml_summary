BSE is a type of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE).
In other words, this implies a second strain of BSE prion.
The finding of a second strain of BSE prion raises the possibility that transmission of BSE to humans has been underestimated, because some of the individuals diagnosed with spontaneous or "sporadic" CJD may have actually contracted the disease from tainted beef.
