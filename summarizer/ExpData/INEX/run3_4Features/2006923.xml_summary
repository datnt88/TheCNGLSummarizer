Servbot (Kobun in Japan, which roughly means "little follower") are a series of characters from the Mega Man Legends'' series.
Each Servbot has its own ability from cooking to cleaning to battle, and they do various chores on board the Bonne family airship the Gesellschaft.
However, by Mega Man Legends 2, the Servbots begin to treat Mega Man more kindly (though still antagonistically), thanks in part to their mother's crush on Mega Man.
