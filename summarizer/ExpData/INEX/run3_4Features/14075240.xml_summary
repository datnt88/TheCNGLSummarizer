Evilhawk is a reptilian alien from the planet Luq with an android body.
When he arrived on Earth, Evilhawk confronted Darkhawk.
Evilhawk was originally unable to use his healing power because his original body had been destroyed, when his Evilhawk android body was destroyed, he existed only as a disembodied consciousness.
