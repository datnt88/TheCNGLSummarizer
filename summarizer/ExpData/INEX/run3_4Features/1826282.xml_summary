The Daewoo Winstorm is a crossover SUV developed by General Motors's GM Daewoo design center in Bupyeong, South Korea.
Winstorm nameplate is only used within South Korea.
The results from the test were helped by the use of high-strength steel used in the body shell which was designed to spread crash forces over distinct load channels, therefore ensuring the safety of the occupants within the safety cell.
