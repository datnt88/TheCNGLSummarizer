Minifigures are small, plastic figural toys produced by Danish toy manufacturer Lego, which are customarily sold with Lego sets, as characters intended to populate modular Lego environments.
The hands of a minifigure resemble the letter C, which allows them to hold many Lego accessories.
In 2001 Lego further expanded the minifigure system, with the introduction of Bionicle figures.
