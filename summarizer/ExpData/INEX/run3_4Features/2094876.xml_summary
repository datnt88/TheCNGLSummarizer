Solanum aculeastrum is commonly known as Soda Apple, Sodaapple Nightshade, Goat Apple, Poison Apple, or more ambiguously as "bitter-apple".
The term "soda apple" probably derives from "sodom apple", modified due to the fruit's detergent properties.
The Soda Apple is often used as a soap replacement, as it is high in saponin.
