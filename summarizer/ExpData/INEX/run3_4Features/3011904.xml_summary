Blackberry thumb is a form of repetitive strain injury caused by the frequent use of the thumb(s) to press buttons on PDAs, smart phones, or other mobile devices.
It is caused by the fact that the thumb does not have the dexterity that the other four fingers have, and is especially common in those who use these devices for such activities at high speeds comparable that of touch typing.
Symptoms of Blackberry thumb include aching and throbbing pain in the thumb or sometimes other fingers and in the wrist.
