He is a playable character in later Mario Party games, starting with Mario Party 5, and again in Mario Party 6, Mario Party 7, and Mario Party 8. Toad was the main character and star in Wario's Woods; his partners in this adventure were Birdo and Wanda.
When the later Mario Tennis game, Mario Power Tennis, came out, Nintendo decided against bringing Toad back into the game alongside Birdo, Baby Mario and Donkey Kong Jr, though he did appear as a cameo with Toadette in the opening movie.
Additionally, Toad is one of the 256 Catch Cards in the game.
