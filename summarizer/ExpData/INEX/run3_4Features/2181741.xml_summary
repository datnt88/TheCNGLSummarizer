Media attention over the choice of North in the role that Monroe rejected resulted in North appearing on the cover of Life magazine with the coverline "Sheree North Takes Over From Marilyn Monroe".
After the success of How to Be Very, Very Popular, North was groomed by Fox as the "new Marilyn Monroe".
North was married four times and had two children.
