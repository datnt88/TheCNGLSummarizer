The Mobile Giving Foundation is a non-profit organization based in Washington, working to increase mobile donating in the US.  The organization in early 2008 fostered a deal between the top four major US carriers, allowing non-profit text message fees to be waived.
The Mobile Giving Foundation in conjunction with the  United Way, Mobile Accord, and mGive launched the first major mobile donating campaign during  Super Bowl XLII.  This was the first time a non-profit mobile donating camping had its fee’s waived from all major US carriers that didn’t involve a major natural disaster.
The Mobile Giving Foundation is headed by Jim Manis, who’s background includes mobile campaigns to help Hurricane Katrina victims and the  Indonesian tsunami.
