Main article: Tropical climateThe seasons in the tropics are dominated by the movement of the tropical rain belt (or ITCZ), which oscillates from the northern to the southern tropics over the course of the year, thus causing the dry season and the wet season in turn.
Direct rays of the sun always shine in and between the tropics.
There are also places in the tropics which are desert, with extreme heat, such as the Sahara Desert and Australian Outback.
