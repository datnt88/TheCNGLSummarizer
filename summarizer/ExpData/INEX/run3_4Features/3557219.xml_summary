Neuroimaging includes the use of various techniques to either directly or indirectly  image the structure, function/pharmacology of the brain.
In early 2000s the field of neuroimaging reached the stage where limited practical applications of functional brain imaging have become feasible.
A distinction is therefore made between "MRI imaging" and "functional MRI imaging" (fMRI), where MRI provides only structural information on the brain while fMRI yields both structural and functional data.
