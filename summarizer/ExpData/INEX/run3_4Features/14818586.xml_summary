SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 18, also known as SOX18, is a human gene.
This gene encodes a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of the cell fate.
This protein plays a role in hair, blood vessel, and lymphatic vessel development.
