Sandfly Bay is a sandy bay with large dunes, located on the eastern side of the Otago Peninsula, New Zealand, 15km east of central Dunedin.
The bay is often thought by locals to have been named for a small biting insect known as the sandfly, but this is incorrect.
It was named for the sand which, given the windy nature of this coast, flies from the tall dunes surrounding the bay.
