Most 'boy racers' do not associate themselves with the term, and instead think of themselves as car enthusiasts.
Often (But not always) these vehicles are modified with things designed to make the car look good rather than go fast, such as lowering (which may improve handling), changing the vehicles colour and putting larger wheels on (which also may improve handling), etc.
These are the few who give most "Boy Racers" (RE: Car Enthusiasts) a bad name, by driving dangerously and are a hazard to the public.
