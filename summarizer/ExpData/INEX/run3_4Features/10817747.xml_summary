For other persons named Ken Thompson, see Ken Thompson (disambiguation).
Thompson had developed the CTSS version of the editor QED, which included regular expressions for searching text.
Regular expressions became pervasive in Unix text processing programs (such as grep), and even in some modern programming languages like Perl; they are a central concept in Rob Pike's sam text editor.
