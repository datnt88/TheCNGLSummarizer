An eruption column consists of hot volcanic ash emitted during an explosive volcanic eruption.
Eruption column heights are a useful way of measuring eruption intensity since for a given atmospheric temperature, the column height is proportional to the fourth power of the mass eruption rate.
Consequently, given similar conditions, to double the column height requires an eruption ejecting 16 times as much material per second.
