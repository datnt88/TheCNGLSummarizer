Mount Okmok is the highest point on the rim of Okmok Caldera (Unmagim Anatuu in Aleut) on the northeastern part of Umnak Island in the eastern Aleutian Islands of Alaska, USA. This 5.8 mile (9.3 km) wide circular caldera truncates the top of a large shield volcano.
On Saturday, July 12, 2008, Okmok Caldera exploded without warning, sending a plume of ash over 33,000 feet (10,000 m) into the air.
Mt. Okmok is roughly 860 miles (1,380 km) southwest of Anchorage and 60 miles (97 km) from the airport at Dutch Harbor, and is to be monitored closely.
