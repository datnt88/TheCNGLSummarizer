New Zealand's Misuse of Drugs Act is a national drug control law that classifies drugs into three classes, or Schedules, based on their risk of harm:
CANNABIS PLANT (whether fresh, dried, or otherwise)—That is, any part of any plant of the genus Cannabis except a part from which all the resin has been extracted.
COCA LEAF—That is, the leaf of any plant of any species of the genus Erythroxylon, except a leaf from which all ecgonine, cocaine, and any other ecgonine alkaloids have been removed.
