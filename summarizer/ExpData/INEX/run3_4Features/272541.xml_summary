Tenosynovitis is the inflammation of the fluid-filled sheath (called the synovium) that surrounds a tendon.
Symptoms of tenosynovitis include pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the particular joint where the inflammation occurs.
Possible treatments for tenosynovitis include cortisone injections (then a course of paracetamol and ibuprofen for pain) and an outpatient surgery to enlarge the synovium.
