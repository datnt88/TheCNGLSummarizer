It was sold in Canada as the Chrysler Intrepid.
The Intrepid SXT was basically a base model Intrepid SE with the 3.5 H.O. engine taken from the R/T. It was a value trim model actually classified as an ES (SXT), but had less features than the ES did with a more powerful motor.
It was estimated that the car would cost $80,000, or roughly $60,000 more than a regular Intrepid.
