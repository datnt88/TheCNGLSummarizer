Eddie has feelings for Linda but won’t say anything as he knows Mickey likes her too ("I’m not saying a word").
He is caught and sentenced to 7 years in prison as Mrs Johnstone mourns the events ("Marilyn Monroe" (Part 3)).
Mickey asks why, even though Eddie has everything and Mickey has nothing, Eddie would take away the one good thing that Mickey had (Linda).
