With Aladdin, its two sequels, the Aladdin television series, House of Mouse, the three Kingdom Hearts games, and Disney Princess Enchanted Tales, Jasmine holds the record for appearing in more media than any of the other Disney princesses, as well as being the first Disney princess not of European descent, plus not to marry a prince.
In an early draft, when Aladdin first met Jasmine, he already knew that she was the Princess.
Princess Jasmine wears many different outfits throughout the movies.
