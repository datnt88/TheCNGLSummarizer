Lanos was designed to replace Daewoo Nexia in the Daewoo lineup and was itself replaced by Daewoo Kalos.
In Australia, the 1997-2003 Daewoo Lanos was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 as providing "worse than average" protection for its occupants in the event of a crash.http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/RoadSafety/VehicleSafety/UsedCarSafetyRatings/Used+Car+Safety+Ratings+-+Light+Small+Cars.htm
