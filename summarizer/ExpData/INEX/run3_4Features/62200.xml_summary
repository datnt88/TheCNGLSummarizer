For example, although ununoctium is a member of the noble gas group, it could have a higher chemical reactivity than some elements outside this group.
See also: Discoveries of the chemical elements===Unsuccessful attempts===In late 1998, Polish physicist Robert Smolanczuk published calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including element 118.
In addition to being far more reactive than radon, ununoctium may be even more reactive than elements 114 and 112.
