The Australian Research Council (ARC) is the Australian Governmentâ€™s main agency for allocating research funding to academics and researchers in Australian universities.
The ARC was established as an independent body under the Australian Research Council Act 2001, and reports to the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training.
Many Australian researchers and academics are critical of the ARC for what they perceive as its overly bureacratic processes.
