It can be argued that the Great Exhibition was mounted in response to the highly successful French Industrial Exposition of 1844.
The building was later moved and re-erected in an enlarged form at Sydenham in south London, an area that was renamed Crystal Palace; it was eventually destroyed by fire.
The Great Exhibition made a surplus of Â£186,000 which was used to found the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum which were all built in the area to the south of the exhibition, nicknamed "Albertopolis", alongside the Imperial Institute.
