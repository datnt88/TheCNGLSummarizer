The SemWare Editor (TSE) is a very flexible text editorwith roots in the MSDOS and MS Windows environment.
TSE features a very capable macro language (SemWare ApplicationLanguage or SAL), regular expression search and replace, keystroke recording and playback, full Undo/Redo, shortcut key assignment (both as configuration and on the fly) that allow extensive modification of the functionality of thetext editor, and other features expected in a modern text editor.
Qedit was rewritten and greatly expanded, ultimately released as The SemWare Editor (TSE) 1.0.
