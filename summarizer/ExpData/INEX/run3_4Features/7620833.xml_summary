The Optimal Diet (or Optimal Nutrition) is a high fat, low carbohydrate diet developed by Polish doctor Jan Kwasniewski.
This works out to about 12% protein, 80% fat, and 8% carbohydrate in caloric percentages.
According to Kwasniewski, the energy requirement on the Optimal Diet is about 25-40% less than on the average diet.
