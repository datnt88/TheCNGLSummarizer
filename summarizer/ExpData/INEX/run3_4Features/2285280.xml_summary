The lab is supported by the National Science Foundation and the State of Florida.
In 1989 a proposal was submitted to the National Science Foundation by representatives of Florida State University, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the University of Florida for a new national user laboratory supporting research in high magnetic fields.
The University of Florida is home to user facilities in magnetic resonance imaging or (MRI) with an ultra-low temperature, ultra-quiet environment for experimental studies in the High B/T (high magnetic field/low temperature) Facility.
