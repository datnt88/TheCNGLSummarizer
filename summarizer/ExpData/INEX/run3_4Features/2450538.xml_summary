The Jiangling Motors Landwind or JMC Landwind (Chinese: 陆风汽车) is a Chinese-built SUV. It is also sold in some European markets, being the first Chinese vehicle that has ever been exported to Europe.
The Landwind has attracted a controversy after a series of safety tests.
Opponents say the TÜV test is not enough to guarantee vehicle safety today.
