The respiratory quotient (RQ) is calculated from the ratio:
The range of respiratory coefficients for organisms in metabolic balance usually ranges from 1.0 (representing the value expected for pure carbohydrate oxidation) to ~0.7 (the value expected for pure fat oxidation).
A mixed diet of fat and carbohydrate results in an average value between these numbers.
