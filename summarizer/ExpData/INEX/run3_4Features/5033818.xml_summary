As in the decade earlier case at Loudun, the exorcisms at Louviers were a public spectacle.
After the nuns at Louviers were afflicted, authorities undertook the task of cataloguing the symptoms of demonic possession.
It is widely believed today that the Louviers Possessions, similar in many ways to those at Aix-en-Provence (1611), Lille (1613), and Loudun (1634) were part of a political and religious "show" in France.
