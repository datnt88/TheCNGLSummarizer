One source of SUVs' popularity is the perception of significant safety advantages over smaller vehicles,. To this, critics claim that SUVs are more likely to roll over, more likely to be in a single-car accident and more likely to cause harm to other road users.
SUV safety concerns are compounded by a perception among some consumers that SUVs are safer for their drivers than standard cars.
Addressing fuel efficiency, several manufacturers now offer hybrid gas/electric models of SUVs, offering improved fuel economy over conventionally powered SUVs. With some hybrid SUV models, the added power generated from the hybrid systems is used some times to give vehicles added performance (increased power).
