This resulted in the breaking out of the First Kashmir War between Indian and Pakistani troops which lasted until 1948, when India moved the issue to the UN Security Council.
The Second Kashmir War began with Pakistan infiltrating into and starting a rebellion in Jammu and Kashmir. (See Operation Gibraltar) The plan was a non-starter and India retaliated by launching an attack on Pakistan thus igniting the war.
This war, despite lasting only a fortnight, saw the highest number of casualties in any of the India-Pakistan conflicts, as well as the largest number of Prisoners of War since the Second World War after the surrender of nearly 100,000 Pakistani troops and civilians.
