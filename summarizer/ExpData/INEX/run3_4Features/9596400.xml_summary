The Dissertation http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393306488 is a novel by R.M. Koster, part of the Tinieblas trilogy.
The book is a mock-PhD thesis, written by the son of the dictator of Tinieblas, recounting his father's rise and fall in a satire of academic prose, while the footnotes narrate the sad life of the doctoral candidate, in the manner of Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire.
