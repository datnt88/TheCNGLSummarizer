Pyroclasts of different sizes are classified as volcanic bombs, lapilli and volcanic ash.
Ash is considered to be pyroclastic because it is a fine dust made up of volcanic rock.
A pyroclastic eruption entails spitting or "fountaining" lava, where the lava will be thrown into the air along with ash, pyroclastic materials, and other volcanic byproducts.
