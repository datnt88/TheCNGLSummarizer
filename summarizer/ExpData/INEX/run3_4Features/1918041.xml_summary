Phantom limb pain is the feeling of pain in an absent limb or a portion of a limb.
Phantom limb pain and phantom limb sensations are linked, but must be differentiated from one another.
Phantom pain may arise from abnormal reorganization in the neuromatrix to a pre-existing pain state (Melzack, 1992).
