The planet Jupiter in particular is a large source of cyclotron radiation.
When the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds, cyclotron radiation is known as synchrotron radiation.
Radiation reaction acts as a resistance to motion in a cyclotron; and the work necessary to overcome it is the main energetic cost of accelerating a particle in a cyclotron.
