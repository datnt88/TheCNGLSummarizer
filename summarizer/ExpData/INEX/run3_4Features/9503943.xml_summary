Equine nutrition is the feeding of horses, ponies, mules, donkeys, and other equines.
Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, it is important to remember the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities.
They also have a long, complex large intestine and a balance of beneficial microbes in their cecum that can be upset by rapid changes in feed.
