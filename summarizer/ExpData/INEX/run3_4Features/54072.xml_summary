Euro banknotes are the banknotes of the euro, the currency of the eurozone (see European Union).
Cyprus and Malta will not print euro notes for the time being, and will use previously issued banknotes from other eurozone member states.
However, country codes have been reserved for both countries, as appears on the ECB Euro banknote FAQ site [https://www.ecb.eu/bc/faqbc/design/html/index.en.html#q10].
