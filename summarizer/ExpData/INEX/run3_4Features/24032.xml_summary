Due to the short half lives of most radioisotopes, the radiotracers must be produced using a  cyclotron and radiochemistry laboratory that are in close proximity to the PET imaging facility.
2D/3D reconstruction: Early PET scanners had only a single ring of detectors, hence the acquisition of data and subsequent reconstruction was restricted to a single transverse plane.
Alternative methods of scanning include x-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ultrasound and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
