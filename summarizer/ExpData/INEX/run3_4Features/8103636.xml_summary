Squirt is a New Zealand children's television show, produced in Dunedin.
There were also weekly competitions, and many informational segments such as "Out There!" and "Astounding Squirt Facts".
It was notable for Dunedin based production company TaylorMade, and Animation Research Limited's (ARL) pioneering use of "live" motion capture, used in the 3D animation of the digital co-host Spike The Penguin.
