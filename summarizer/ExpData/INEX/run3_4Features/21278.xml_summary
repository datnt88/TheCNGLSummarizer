In 1992, the IUPAC-IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) assessed the claims of discovery and concluded that only the Dubna work from 1966 correctly detected and assigned decays to Z=102 nuclei at the time.
Contrary to some suggestions, at no time has element 102 been referred to as unnilbium  due to the above circumstances.
This is most definitely only an estimate since a true value can only be determined using a chemical compound of the element and no such compounds exist for nobelium.
