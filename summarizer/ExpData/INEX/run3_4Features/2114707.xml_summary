The Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) was re-opened in 1990 with headquarters in Budapest, Hungary.
Following World War II, after the nationalisation of the majority of private Hungarian firms, the government officially dissolved the Budapest Stock and Commodity Exchange, and the exchangeâ€™s assets became state property.
Effective 1 July 2002, the Budapest Stock Exchange Company Ltd. was set up (and from April 2006, as a Private Limited Company) and  the BSE Council and BSE Secretariat were replaced by a Board of Directors and an Executive Board.
