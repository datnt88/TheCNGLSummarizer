The Coca-Cola formula is The Coca-Cola Company's secret recipe for Coca-Cola.
Because cocaine is naturally present in coca leaves, today's Coca-Cola uses "spent", or treated, coca leaves, those that have been through a cocaine extraction process, to flavor the beverage.
The Coca-Cola Company currently refuses to comment on the continued presence of coca leaf in Coca-Cola.
