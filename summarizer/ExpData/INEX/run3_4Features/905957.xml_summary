Human height varies according to both "nature" and "nurture".
The reasons for this association appear to include that height serves as a biomarker of nutritional status or general mental and physical health during development, that common genetic factors may influence both height and intelligence, and that both height and intelligence are affected by adverse early environmental exposures.
Unlike rugby union, height is not generally seen as important, often extreme height being a hindrance rather than a useful attribute.
