Sleepy People (later renamed Blue Apple Boy) were/are a British psychedelic rock band known for their eccentric and energetic songs and live act, and for incubating three of the five future members of short-lived (but briefly famous) Britpop band Ultrasound.
In 1994, the band issued their first album Blunt Nails In A Sharp Wall on self-released cassette.
The band’s tone became less fanciful and more sinister with a second single, “Freak” on the band’s own Bad Apple Records.
