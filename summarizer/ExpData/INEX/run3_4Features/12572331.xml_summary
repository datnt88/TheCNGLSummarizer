The current series of Danish banknotes (as of 2007) were introduced during 1997-1999, replacing the 1972 series.
The Danish National bank first used it on the 50 krone banknote issued in 1957, and the present banknote is thus the third to use this word.
When the banknotes are tilted, various motifs appear in the hologram.
