Aurora grows into a very beautiful young woman with long golden yellow hair, rose-colored lips, lilac-colored eyes, and a marvelous singing voice, 'with golden sunshine in her hair and lips that shame the red red rose'.
The name of the beautiful Sleeping Beauty is "Princess Aurora" (Latin for "dawn"), in this film, as it was in the original Tchaikovsky ballet; this name occurred in Perrault's version, not as the princess's name, but as her daughter's.
In 2003, the restored Sleeping Beauty was released to DVD in a 2-disc "Special Edition" which included both a widescreen version (formatted at 2.35:1) and a pan and scan version as well.
