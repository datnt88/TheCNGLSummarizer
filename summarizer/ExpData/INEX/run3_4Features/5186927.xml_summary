"The Soup Nazi" is the title of the 116th episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld, which was the 6th episode of the 7th season.
Elaine goes to thank the Soup Nazi for the armoire, but the Soup Nazi declares that he never would have given it to Kramer if he knew it was for her.
The first reference to the character (though not by name) seems to have come years before the Seinfeld episode in the 1993 movie Sleepless in Seattle.
