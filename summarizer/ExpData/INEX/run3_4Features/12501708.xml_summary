nimoca (ニモカ, Nimoka) is a rechargeable contactless smart card ticketing system for public transport in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan.
Its name is an acronym of "nice money card", while nimo (にも, nimo) in Japanese means "also", as the card will be usable on buses, also on trains, also on shopping, etc. Like other electronic fare collection systems in Japan, the card uses RFID technology developed by Sony corporation known as FeliCa.
The three cards in Fukuoka and Suica, a card already used in Greater Tokyo Area by East Japan Railway Company (JR East), will have integrated services from spring 2010.
