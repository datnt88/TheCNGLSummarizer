The Henry Doorly Zoo, located at 3701 South 10th Street, is a zoo in Omaha, Nebraska.
It features the largest cat complex in North America; "Kingdoms of the Night" is the world's largest nocturnal exhibit and indoor swamp; the Lied Jungle is the world's largest indoor rainforest, and the "Desert Dome" is the world's largest indoor desert, as well as the largest geodesic dome in the world.
The Henry Doorly Zoo, like most zoos, is not an amusement park, although it does have two rides that circumnavigate the zoo and a carousel.
