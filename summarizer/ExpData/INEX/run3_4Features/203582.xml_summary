Syagrius governed this Gallo-Roman enclave from the death of his father in 464 until 486, when whatever remained of Roman Gaul was overrun by the territorial expansion of the Frankish kingdom of Clovis I.
While this may not have been the end of Clovis's campaign, the outcome was no longer in doubt and the Franks methodically occupied the remaining Gallo-Roman territory.
His regime represented the last recorded instance of native Gallo-Roman authority in Gaul; in fact he was known to the Germanic barbarians as the "King of the Romans".
