Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams is a direct-to-video animated feature produced by DisneyToon Studios.
Originally, Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: A Kingdom of Kindness was announced as the first film in the series, which contained a different Princess Aurora story in which Aurora and the fairies planned a birthday for Prince Philip and had a Belle story rather than a Princess Jasmine story.
A preview for it was included on the Follow Your Dreams DVD, which merely refers to it as Disney Princess Enchanted Tales.
