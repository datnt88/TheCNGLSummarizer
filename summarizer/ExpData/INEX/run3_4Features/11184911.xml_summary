Photographic emulsion is a layer of light-sensitive material coated onto a substrate.
In Silver-gelatin photography, the emulsion consists of silver halide crystals suspended in gelatin, and the substrate may be glass, plastic film, paper or fabric.
Sensitizing solutions for non-silver gelatin processes, such as dichromated colloid processes, cyanotype and kallitype are also called emulsion.
