Natural History New Zealand Ltd (NHNZ) is a small New Zealand-based documentary production company that creates more than 60 hours of television programming each year.
In addition to the base in Dunedin, New Zealand, NHNZ has offices in Beijing and Washington DC. It works closely alongside major networks around the world such as Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, Discovery Health, TLC, National Geographic Channel, PBS (US), NHK (Japan), France 5 and NDR (Germany).
A series of four 15minute programmes called Hidden Places and which featured various New Zealand habitats, notably Okarito, White Island and near-to Dunedin â€“ Sinclair Wetlands, firmly established the unit.
