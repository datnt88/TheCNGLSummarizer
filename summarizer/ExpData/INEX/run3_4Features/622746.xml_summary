The Columbian Exchange has been one of the most significant events in the history of world ecology, agriculture, and culture.
The Columbian Exchange greatly affected almost every society on earth, bringing destructive diseases that depopulated many cultures, and also circulating a wide variety of new crops and livestock that, in the long term, increased rather than diminished the world human population.
This led, in part, to the devastating effects of Old World diseases on Native American populations.
