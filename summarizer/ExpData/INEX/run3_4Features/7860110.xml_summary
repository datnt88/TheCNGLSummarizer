Human sex determination refers to the processes by which an individual becomes either a male or female during development.
Those individuals with a Y chromosome (including XXY, XXXY, etc.) will develop into males, and those without one will become female.
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, coinciding with the mapping of the human genome, researchers began to look for the specific gene on the Y chromosome that, up until then, had been known as the testis determining factor (TDF).
