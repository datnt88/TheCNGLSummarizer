John Mark Purdey (December 25 1953 â€“ November 12 2006) was a British organic farmer who came to public attention in the 1980s, when he began to investigate the causes of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow disease").
The Guardian writes that Purdey was regarded as an "irritant" by the British scientific establishment.
Purdey began to educate himself about the science of OPs just as the first recorded case of BSE was confirmed.
