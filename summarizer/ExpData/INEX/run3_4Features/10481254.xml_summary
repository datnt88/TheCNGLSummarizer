Gala Brand is a policewoman assigned to England's Special Branch.
After Drax interrogates Bond and Gala, Bond uses a blowtorch with his mouth to burn through the wires restraining Gala.
Gala is the most professional of all of Fleming's Bond Girls, being practically the only one to have an independent career.
