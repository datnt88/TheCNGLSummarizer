A large glass of red wine contains about three units of alcohol.  A regular glass such as the one shown maybe contain about 2 units.

In Britain a <b>unit of alcohol</b> is defined as 10 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../094/18094.xml">
millilitres</link> (or approximately 8 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../839/146839.xml">
gram</link>s) of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../de)/10048_(Z$I$P$_code).xml">
ethanol</link> (ethyl alcohol). It is used as a basis for guidelines on consumption of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../043/18948043.xml">
alcoholic beverages</link>; the number of units contained in a typical drink is publicised and marked on bottles.

 Formulae </st>
<p>

The number of units of alcohol in a drink can be determined by multiplying the volume of the drink (in millilitres) by its percentage <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../309/409309.xml">
ABV</link>, and dividing by 1000 (or litres &amp;times; % abv). Thus, one <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../881/222881.xml">
pint</link> (568ml) of beer at 4%&nbsp;ABV contains:</p>
<p>

<math>\frac{568 \times 4}{1000} = 2.3\mbox{ units}</math></p>
<p>

The formula uses the quantity in millilitres divided by 1000; this has the result of there being exactly <it>one unit per percentage point per litre</it> of any alcoholic beverage.</p>
<p>

As the volume of alcoholic drinks is becoming increasingly shown in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../094/18094.xml">
centilitre</link>s, discerning the number of units in a drink can be as simple as multiplying volume by percentage (converted into a fraction of 1). Thus, 75 centilitres of wine at 13 % ABV contains:</p>
<p>

<math>75 \times 0.13 = 9.75\mbox{ units}</math></p>

It is often misleadingly stated that a unit is supplied by a small glass of wine,  half a pint of beer, or a single measure of spirits.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> Such statements are misleading because they do not reflect the large differences in strengths and measures of wines, beers and spirits.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>

A half pint (284ml) of ordinary strength (3.5-4% abv) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../363/3363.xml">
beer</link> contains about one unit. However, some beers are stronger. In pubs, beers generally range from 4% to 5.5% abv with continental lagers starting at around 5% abv. A pint of such lager (568ml at 5.2% for example) is almost 3 units of alcohol, rather than the often-quoted value of 2 units per pint.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

A 500ml can/bottle of standard <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../312/19555312.xml">

A small glass (125ml) of 8% abv <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/32961.xml">
wine</link> contains one unit of alcohol. However, British pubs and restaurants usually supply larger quantities (medium: 175 ml or large: 250 ml), and few wines are as weak as 8%; 12% is more typical. A standard pub measure (medium glass - 175 ml) of white wine (at 12%) contains around 2 units and a large glass (250 ml) contains 3 units. Red wine, which usually has a higher alcohol content (up to 16%), contains for an average 14% abv an alcohol content of 3.5 units for a large (250 ml glass), approximately one-sixth higher than a typical white wine. Just two bottles of 14% abv red wine a week will supply the maximum intake of alcohol for a man recommended by UK health guidelines.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

A 750ml bottle of 12% wine contains 9 units. Many wines may contain 14% abv or more, which is just over 10 units of alcohol per bottle.</entry>

 Limits </st>
<p>

Since 1995 the UK government has advised that regular consumption of between three and four units a day for men and between two and three units a day for women would not pose significant health risks, but that consistently drinking four or more units a day (men) or three or more units a day (women) is not advisable<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>. Previously (from 1992 until 1995) the advice was that men should drink no more than 21 units per week, and women no more than 14.  This was changed because a government study showed that many people were in effect "saving" up their units and "using" them at the end of the week, a phenomenon referred to as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../348/19592348.xml">
binge drinking</link>.  The difference between sexes is given due to the (typically) lower weight and water-to-body-mass-ratio of women. </p>
<p>

It was claimed in October 2007 that these limits had been "plucked out of the air" and have no scientific basis.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

An international study (Kanis, 2005) of almost 6,000 men and 11,000 women found that persons who reported that they drank more than 2 units of alcohol a day had an increased risk of fractures compared to non-drinkers.  For example, those who drank over 3 units a day had nearly twice the risk of a hip fracture.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
