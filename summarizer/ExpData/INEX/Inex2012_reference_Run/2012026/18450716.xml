Alcohol</link> is a highly-abused substance that greatly exacerbates sleep problems. During <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../546/18589546.xml">
abstinence</link>, residual disruptions in sleep maintenance and sleep architecture are the greatest predictors of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../513/1662513.xml">
relapse</link> [1].</p>

Moderate alcohol consumption and sleep disruptions</st>

<p>

Moderate alcohol consumption 30-60 minutes before bedtime <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../914/5914.xml">
catalyzes</link> disruptions in sleep maintenance and sleep architecture that are mediated by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/4845.xml">
blood alcohol level</link>s [2]. Disruptions in sleep maintenance are most marked once alcohol has been completely <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../374/20374.xml">
metabolized</link> from the body. Under conditions of moderate alcohol consumption where blood alcohol levels average 0.06-0.08 percent and decrease 0.01-0.02 percent per hour, an alcohol clearance rate of 4-5 hours would coincide with disruptions in sleep maintenance in the second half of an 8 hr sleep episode [2]. In terms of sleep architecture, moderate doses of alcohol facilitate "rebounds" in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../184/167184.xml">
rapid eye movement</link> (REM) and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../834/27834.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Stages+of+sleep%22])">
stage 1 sleep</link>; following suppression in REM and stage 1 sleep in the first half of an 8 hr sleep episode, REM and stage 1 sleep increase well beyond baseline in the second half. Moderate doses of alcohol also increase <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/2708147.xml">
slow wave sleep</link> (SWS) in the first half of an 8 hr sleep episode [2]. Enhancements in REM sleep and SWS following moderate alcohol consumption are mediated by reductions in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../541/63541.xml">
glutamatergic</link> activity by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../108/89108.xml">
adenosine</link> in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/7251.xml">
central nervous system</link> [2]. In addition, tolerance to changes in sleep maintenance and sleep architecture develops within 3 days of alcohol consumption before bedtime [2].</p>

Alcohol consumption and sleep improvements</st>

<p>

Low doses of alcohol (one 12 oz. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../363/3363.xml">
beer</link>) are sleep-promoting by increasing total sleep time and reducing awakenings during the night. The sleep-promoting benefits of alcohol <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../572/164572.xml">
dissipate</link> at moderate and higher doses of alcohol (two 12 oz beers and three 12 oz. beers, respectively) [3]. Previous experience with alcohol also determines whether or not alcohol is a "sleep promoter" or "sleep disrupter." Under free-choice conditions, in which subjects chose between drinking alcohol or water, inexperienced drinkers were sedated while experienced drinkers were stimulated following alcohol consumption [4]. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../798/50798.xml">
insomnia</link>cs, moderate doses of alcohol improve sleep maintenance [5].</p>

<st>
Alcohol consumption and fatigue</st>

<p>

Sleepiness influences the severity of alcohol consumption. Conditions of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../893/18597893.xml">
sleep deprivation</link> encourage more episodes of alcohol consumption [2]. Increased alcohol consumption during the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../061/34061.xml">
winter</link> months for Northern climate residents is attributed to escalations in fatigue [6].</p>

<st>
Alcohol abstinence and sleep disruptions</st>

<p>

Sleep and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../311/13311.xml">
hormonal</link> disruptions following withdrawal from chronic alcohol consumption are the greatest predictors of relapse [1]. During abstinence, recovering alcoholics have attenuated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../157/285157.xml">
melatonin</link> secretion in the beginning of a sleep episode, resulting in prolonged sleep latencies [7]. Escalations in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../380/335380.xml">
cortisol</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../432/1156432.xml">
core body temperature</link>s during the sleep period contribute to poor sleep maintenance [7,8].</p>
