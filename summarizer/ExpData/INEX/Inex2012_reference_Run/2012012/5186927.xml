 has been raving about; its owner is referred to as the "Soup Nazi" due to his temperament and insistence on a strict manner of behavior while ordering. Jerry explains the procedure for ordering which George accepts, but Elaine rebuffs. Elaine notices a sidewalk furniture dealer with an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/10542070.xml">
armoire</link> for sale and decides to stop and buy it. However, when she returns to her building with it, the super tells her there is no moving on Sundays.</p>
<p>

When Jerry and George get to the soup stand, George follows the procedure but notices that he did not get bread with his soup. Jerry tells him to let it go but he asks for some, and is told he will have to pay for it. George objects, and quickly has his money returned and his soup taken back with the Soup Nazi's famous <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../944/251944.xml">
catchphrase</link> "No soup for you!".</p>
<p>

Meanwhile, Jerry has been annoying George and Elaine with his open affection and baby talk (calling each other "Schmoopie") towards his new girlfriend Sheila (<actor wordnetid="109765278" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../441/277441.xml">

). When Sheila would not stop kissing Jerry in line at the soup stand, the Soup Nazi kicks her out and Jerry is forced to pretend he does not know her. When he finds out, George admits his annoyance to Jerry. Jerry later tells Sheila he was joking and makes up with her. When George finds out, he begins to act similarly with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../846/2097846.xml">
Susan</link> to make a point. Susan misinterprets George's intentions and thinks that George is finally enjoying showing his feelings in public, continuing to act that way after Jerry again breaks up with Sheila.</p>
<p>

Elaine asks Kramer to guard her armoire on the street overnight. When he arrives, she goes to the soup stand to get him soup. While she is gone, a pair of "street thugs" intimidate Kramer and steal the armoire. Elaine ignores everyone's prior advice and annoys the Soup Nazi with her behavior. He refuses her soup and bans her from getting soup for a year. She returns to her building to find Kramer without the armoire. Kramer, who has become friends with the Soup Nazi, tells him the story in passing. The Soup Nazi offers Kramer an antique armoire he has in his basement. Kramer gives the armoire to Elaine as a replacement for her stolen one. Elaine goes to thank the Soup Nazi for the armoire, but the Soup Nazi declares that he never would have given it to Kramer if he knew it was for her. Offended, Elaine returns home to discover the Soup Nazi's secret <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/97845.xml">

The Soup Nazi character makes a brief cameo in the <it>Seinfeld</it> <episode wordnetid="106396330" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

The first reference to the character (though not by name) seems to have come years before the <it>Seinfeld</it> episode in the 1993 movie <it><movie wordnetid="106613686" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

</it>. In the film, a magazine writer discusses writing a story: "This man sells the greatest soup you have ever eaten, and he is the meanest man in America. I feel very strongly about this, Becky; it's not just about the soup." Nora Ephron comments on the DVD that she believes this is the first entertainment-media reference to the Soup Nazi.</p>

Prior to his fictional counterpart's appearance on <it>Seinfeld</it>, the real Al Yeganeh was unflatteringly referred to by local patrons as the "Terrorist." His soups were renowned for their excellent quality, but his interactions with customers seemed somewhat capricious.

. One day, during production of the eighth season of <it>Seinfeld</it>, Seinfeld and several writers went to Yeganeh's soup stand for lunch. Upon recognizing Seinfeld, Yeganeh launched into a profanity-laced rant about how "The Soup Nazi" episode had "ruined his life", and he demanded an apology. Seinfeld gave what writer <actor wordnetid="109765278" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

A small "Crepes to Go" restaurant in Santa Monica, CA could have been a real-life inspiration for the episode.  The owner, who stays well hidden behind hanging signs demands you make up your mind well ahead of time and doesn't put up with "idiots who can't decide."  If you snicker about the silly and demanding signs then the restaurant is "temporarily closed" to you.  2217 Sawtelle Blvd, Los Angeles, CA  90064   </entry>
