The <b>Demon Murder Trial</b> is the first known case in the United States of a lawyer claiming his client was innocent due to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../574/246574.xml">
demonic possession</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> It involved the conviction of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, a resident of <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

landlord</link> Alan Bono on November 24, 1981.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> In the year leading up to the attack on Bono, Johnson had been staying with his fiancee whose younger brother supposedly had been possessed by demons and whose family called in the famed demonologists <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../768/2467768.xml">
Ed and Lorraine Warren</link>. Johnson supposedly taunted and was possessed by demons from the boy, and several months later killed his landlord during a heated conversation. His defense lawyer tried to argue in court that he was possessed, but the judge ruled that no such defense existed, and Johnson served 5 years of a 10 to 20 year sentence. The trial attracted media attention from around the world.</p>

Events preceding the attack</st>
<p>

On July 3, 1980, Arne Johnson's fiancee, Debbie Glatzel, claimed to have discovered that her youngest brother David woke sobbing, saying that he had a vision of an "awful beast", describing it as "a man with big black eyes, a thin face with animal features and jagged teeth, pointed ears, horns and hoofs", and saying it had warned him to "Beware". As his visions persisted, Debbie requested that Johnson come and stay at her family's home. A catholic priest came to their house and blessed it, but to seemingly no effect on David. Visions began to occur in the daytime soon afterwards, in the form of an old man with a white beard, wearing a flannel shirt and jeans. Twelve days after the first incident, the family called upon <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../601/174601.xml">
demonologist</link>s <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../768/2467768.xml">
Ed and Lorraine Warren</link> of Monroe, Connecticut to assist. Lorraine, who claims to be <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../737/7737.xml">
clairvoyant</link>, stated that she saw a black, misty form next to David, indicating a malevolent presence, and that David complained of invisible hands choking him, and the feeling of being hit. She also claims that afterwards, there were red marks on his neck. David's condition caused him to start missing school, and David also gained 60 pounds over the next few months. He also began to growl, hiss, speak in strange voices, and suddenly recite passages from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../390/3390.xml">
Bible</link> or <it><text wordnetid="106387980" confidence="0.8">

</it>. Each night, the family says that a family member would remain awake with David through sometime 30 minute long rapid spasms and convulsions. The Warrens claim that three "lesser exorcisms" took place, the first with four priests in attendance, and that when asked how many demons where inside him, David listed 43 names. She also claims David had marks all over his body, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../844/597844.xml">
levitate</link>d, and demonstrated the supernatural ability of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../253/40253.xml">
precognition</link> relating to the murder Johnson would later commit. In October 1980, the Warrens contacted Brookfield police to warn them that the situation was becoming dangerous.</p>
<p>

While staying with Debbie's family, Johnson supposedly taunted the demons said to be within David to possess his own body while participating in David's exorcisms.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> "Take me on, take me on instead of him" Johnson is purported to have said. The Warrens claimed to have warned him not to do this, but Johnson refused to listen. As David's condition worsened, Debbie and Johnson moved out; Debbie was hired by Alan Bono, a new resident of the town, as a dog groomer at the Brookfield Pet Motel, and given an nearby apartment to stay at. It was then that Johnson's behavior supposedly began to change, and made Debbie fear that he had become possessed as well. According to Debbie, Johnson would go into a kind of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../146/2115146.xml">
trance</link>, where he would growl, and say he saw a beast, but later have no memory of it.</p>

The attack</st>
<p>

On February 16, 1981, Johnson called in sick to his job at Wright Tree Service, claiming he had a sore throat.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> He joined his girlfriend Debbie at the animal clinic where she worked along with her sister and cousin. Alan Bono, the couples 40 year old landlord and Debbie's employer at the kennel,  bought the whole group lunch at a local bar, with Bono, Johnson, and Debbie all drinking wine, Bono more than the rest of the group.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> After lunch, the group returned to the dog kennels, where Johnson fixed Bono's stereo, which blared noisily.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Debbie then took the girls to get pizza, but insisted they return quickly, saying "There's going to be trouble."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> When they returned, Bono invited everyone up to his apartment above the kennel, and when the television was turned on, it too was very loud, and Bono became agitated, punching his fist into his palm.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Everyone left the room at Debbies urging, except Bono seized Debbie's nine year old cousin Mary and would not let go.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Johnson, who had walked to the car, headed back to the apartment and told Bono to release Mary.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Wanda Johnson, who recounted her story to the police, stated that "it just broke".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Mary ran for the car, an Debbie stood between the two men.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Wanda, who was holding on to Johnson, remembers he was "like stone", and couldn't be moved. Wanda heard Johnson growling like an animal, saw a flash through the air, and stated that "it just stopped".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Johnson walked towards the woods, staring straight ahead, and Bono continued to punch his fist into his palm, before falling on his face.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Bono had suffered "four or five tremendous wounds" according to Johnson's lawyer from a 5-inch (130&nbsp;mm) pocket knife, mostly on his chest, and one that stretched from his stomach to the base of his heart.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Bono died several hours later from his wounds.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> Johnson was discovered two miles (3 km) from the site of the murder and was held at the Bridgeport Correctional Center on bail of 125,000 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../338/18717338.xml">

Media reaction and legal proceedings</st>

<p>

Lorraine Warren called Brookfield police the day after the murder to tell them that Johnson was possessed.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> A "media blitz" began to surround the story, and the Warrens began to spread the story throughout the press, promising to lecture about it, write a book, and make a movie about it through their agents at William Morris.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Martin Minella, Johnson's lawyer, said he received calls from all over the world about the case, and news spread to the point that Minella was recognized on the streets of London by passersby.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Minella traveled to England to meet with lawyers who had been involved in two similar cases (though neither ever went to trial), planned to fly in exorcism specialists from Europe, and threatened to subpoena the priests involved if they would not cooperate.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

The trial took place in Danbury, Connecticut Superior Court beginning on October 28, 1981.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Minella entered the unprecedented plea of not guilty by virtue of possession by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/8539.xml">
devil</link>, but the presiding judge, Robert Callahan, rejected Johnson's lawyer's attempt to show that Johnson was under the influence of a demon at the time of the murder. Callahan stated that there was no such defense, and it would be "irrelative and unscientific" to allow such testimony, forcing the defense attorney to argue instead that Johnson acted in self-defense.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> The jury thus never heard Minella's theory.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> The jury deliberated for 15 hours over three days before convicting Johnson on November 24, 1981, of first-degree <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../035/7397035.xml">
manslaughter</link>, and was sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison, of which he served 5.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

Aftermath</st>

After he served his sentence, Johnson went on to marry his fiancee.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> The alleged incident led to the creation of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../342/164342.xml">
