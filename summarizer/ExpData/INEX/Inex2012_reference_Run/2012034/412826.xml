ministries</link></b> are activities carried out by individuals or groups aimed at solving problems related to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../280/8280.xml">

<p>

Deliverance ministries focus on casting out the spirit or spirits believed to cause an affliction.  The method of casting out varies. Some adherents directly recite <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../390/3390.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22The+Christian+Bible%22])">
Biblical</link> examples in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/25042.xml">
prayer</link> intended to command a demon to depart an afflicted person, and do not believe an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../115/217115.xml">
ordained</link> clergy is required perform the deliverance.  Though many people confuse deliverance with exorcism, they are not the same. Exorcisms use the "holy" water as the main expulsion technique, while deliverance uses the authority Jesus Christ gave His church through his victory on the cross with his shed blood. </p>
<p>

Ministries also organize the removal from homes of items that are believed to harbor demons, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../170/231170.xml">
fantasy</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../109/14109.xml">
horror</link><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../882/21882.xml">
