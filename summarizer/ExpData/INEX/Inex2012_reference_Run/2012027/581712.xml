Sweetening</st>


<p>

Different artificial sweeteners are used instead of sugar to give diet soda a sweet taste and some are often used simultaneously. Opinion is mixed as to the taste of these beverages: some think they lack the taste of their sugar-sweetened counterparts, others think the taste is similar.  Some also note an unusual non-sugary <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../098/2121098.xml">
aftertaste</link>. Some feel the opposite—that diet soda has no aftertaste and that soda sweetened by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../752/2366752.xml">
high fructose corn syrup</link> has a gritty, over-sweet aftertaste. </p>

, is one of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners. It had the commercial disadvantage of  being linked in the public mind with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../219/105219.xml">
cancer</link>, and by the mid-1980s, American manufacturers were switching en masse from saccharin to aspartame.  The 1982 introduction of aspartame-sweetened <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../770/105770.xml">

 accelerated this trend.  Today, at least in the United States, "diet" is nearly synonymous with the use of aspartame in beverages.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Cyclamates</st>
<p>

The first artificial sweeteners used in diet soda were <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../936/249936.xml">
cyclamate</link>s (often <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../859/26859.xml">
synergistically</link> with saccharin).  While many say these cyclamate-sweetened soda had a more pleasant taste than the diet soda that followed them, in 1970 the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/11632.xml">
Food and Drug Administration</link> banned cyclamates in the <body wordnetid="107965085" confidence="0.8">

 on evidence that they caused cancer in lab <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../471/26471.xml">
rats</link>.  Cyclamates are still used in many countries around the world, including for diet soda.</p>

</ss1>

<st>
Saccharin</st>
<p>

Once cyclamates were banned, American producers turned to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../043/323043.xml">
saccharin</link>.  Saccharin alone was often criticized for having a bitter taste and "chemical" aftertaste.  Some manufacturers, such as <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../690/6690.xml">

 with <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../985/599985.xml">
Tab</link></beverage>
, attempted to rectify this by adding a small amount of sugar.  In 1977, the FDA was petitioned to ban saccharin, too, as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../445/6445.xml">
carcinogen</link>, but a moratorium was placed on the ban until studies were conducted.  The ban was lifted in 1991, but by that time, virtually all diet soda production had shifted to using aspartame. Perhaps the most notable holdout is <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../985/599985.xml">

, which nevertheless also uses some aspartame in its formula.</p>

 is the non-aspartame diet soda brand with the highest sales today; it uses a combination of sucralose and acesulfame potassium.</p>
<p>

Advocates say drinks employing these sweeteners have a more natural sugar-like taste than those made just with aspartame and do not have a strong aftertaste.  The newer aspartame-free drinks can also be safely consumed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/23251.xml">
phenylketonurics</link>, because they do not contain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../001/38001.xml">
phenylalanine</link>.  Critics say the taste is not better, merely different, or note that the long-term health risks of all or certain artificial sweeteners is unclear.</p>
<p>

The widespread, though not universal, agreement that the newest formulations taste much more "normal" (sugar-like) than the older diet sodas have prompted some producers, such as <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../428/637428.xml">
Jones Soda</link></company>
, to abandon the "diet" label entirely in favor of "sugar-free soda," implying that the taste is good enough to drink the soda even when not trying to lose weight. (This idea was first floated by <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../770/105770.xml">
Diet Coke</link></beverage>
 in 1984, with the tagline, "Just For the Taste of It.")</p>
<p>

In 2005, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../869/914869.xml">
Coca-Cola Company</link> announced it would produce a new formulation of <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 sweetened with sucralose, to be called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../770/105770.xml">
Diet Coke with Splenda</link>, but it would continue to produce the aspartame version as well.  There were also rumors that a sugar-free version of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../690/6690.xml">
Coca-Cola Classic</link>, also sweetened with sucralose, was being formulated as well. This formulation was eventually called <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

History</st>
<p>

The beginning of the diet soda or refreshment era was in 1952, when Kirsch Bottling in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../384/47384.xml">
Brooklyn, New York</link> launched a sugar free <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../379/193379.xml">
ginger ale</link> called <link>
No-Cal</link>. It was designed for diabetics, not dieters, and distribution remained local. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../578/54578.xml">
Royal Crown Cola</link> placed an announcement in an <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/3138.xml">

 newspaper in 1958 announcing a diet soda product, <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../459/684459.xml">
Diet Rite</link></beverage>
. In 1963, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../869/914869.xml">
Coca-Cola Company</link> joined the diet soda market with <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../985/599985.xml">
Tab</link></beverage>
, which proved to be a huge success. Tab was originally sweetened with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../936/249936.xml">
cyclamates</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../043/323043.xml">
saccharin</link>.</p>
<p>

Tab, Diet Rite, and <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 (a grapefruit-flavored soda introduced by Coca-Cola) were about the only well-known diet refreshment on the markets until <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../573/24573.xml">

 released <fact wordnetid="105817396" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../000/1055000.xml">

 in the 1960s (initially as <b>Patio Diet Cola</b>). Coca-Cola countered by releasing <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../770/105770.xml">
Diet Coke</link></beverage>
 in 1982. After the release of Diet Coke, Tab took a backseat at the Coca-Cola production lines; Diet Coke could be more easily identified by consumers as associated with <beverage wordnetid="107881800" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../690/6690.xml">
Coca-Cola</link></beverage>
 than Tab. Also, a study was released revealing that saccharin was a possible <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../445/6445.xml">
carcinogen</link>, leading to Coca-Cola's decision of pushing Tab's production numbers down. During the middle 1980s also, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../014/1014.xml">
alcohol</link> industry began to follow lead to the refreshment industry, with some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../363/3363.xml">
beer</link> companies putting sugar-free beer on the market.</p>
<p>

By the start of the 1990s, a wide array of different companies had their own diet refreshments on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../175/65175.xml">
supermarket</link> shelves. Tab made a comeback during the late 1990s, after new studies demonstrated that saccharin is not an important factor in the risk of cancer. Nevertheless, the Coca-Cola Company has maintained its 1984 reformulation, replacing some of the saccharin in Tab with NutraSweet.</p>
<p>

By 2002, some soda companies had diversified to include such flavors as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../623/32623.xml">
vanilla</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../437/38437.xml">
lemon</link> among their products, and diet sodas were soon begun to be produced with those flavors too (see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../576/297576.xml">
Diet Vanilla Coke</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../573/24573.xml">
Diet Pepsi Vanilla</link>). By 2004, several alcohol companies had begun to release sugar-free or "diet" alcoholic products too.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

<p>

Along with possible health concerns of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../880/58880.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Sugar+substitute+health+controversies%22])">
sugar substitutes</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../868/6868.xml">
caffeine</link> overuse, the effectiveness of diet soda as a weight loss tool should also be considered.</p>
<p>

Changing the food energy intake from one food will not necessarily change a person's overall food energy intake, or cause a person to lose weight. One study,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, reported by Sharon Fowler at the ADA annual meeting, actually suggested the opposite, where consumption of diet soda was correlated with weight gain. While Fowler did suggest that the undelivered expected calories from diet soda may stimulate the appetite, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../834/39834.xml">
correlation does not prove</link> that consumption of diet soda caused the weight gain. The weight gain may have caused the consumption of diet soda. The ADA has yet to issue an updated policy concerning diet soda.</p>
<p>

An independent study by researchers with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../689/1471689.xml">
Framingham Heart Study</link> in Massachusetts, has turned up results which indicate that the consumption of diet soda correlates with increased <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../439/54439.xml">
metabolic syndrome</link>. Of the 9,000 males and females studied, findings stated that 48% of the subjects were at higher risk for weight gain and elevated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../406/289406.xml">
blood sugar</link>. The researchers also acknowledged that diet soda drinkers were less likely to consume healthy foods, and that drinking diet soda flavored with artificial sweeteners more than likely increases cravings for sugar flavored sweets.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

Individuals who drink excessive amounts of regular soda may experience weight loss if they switch to diet soda.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
<p>

Animal studies suggest that artificial sweeteners cause body weight gain, theoretically because of a faulty insulin response, at least in cows and rats. Rats given sweeteners have steadily increased caloric intake, increased body weight, and increased adiposity (fatness). <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Adding saccharin to the food of calves increases their body weight as well.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

, is a combination of corn syrup, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose.
In May 2005, Pepsi announced that they will abandon the market by the end of the year, citing lackluster sales.  It is rumored that Coke is soon to follow suit.</p>
<p>

Half the sugar of a can of regular cola is still more sugar than many people on popular low-carbohydrate diets are permitted to have in a day. It is possible that these sodas are targeted, instead, at so-called "carb-conscious consumers" who are paying attention to, but not trying to drastically reduce, their carbohydrate intake.</p>
