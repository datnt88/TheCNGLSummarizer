1999</link> David Osborne Hagger appeared by Statement 476 before the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../418/19344418.xml">
BSE Inquiry</link>. He testified regarding the actions of civil servants and scientists under his administration concerning animal byproducts used during the licensed manufacture of medicines and vaccines in the United Kingdom. Of particular concern was the possibility of a health risk to thousands of British children who had received innocuations of vaccine that potentionally could have been contaminated by BSE during their licensed manufacture. No individual records had been kept as a central registry to identify specific children inoculated with these vaccines and consequently it became necessary to question every government official with regards to their own actions in the licensing of medicines and vaccines.</p>

 (<it>mad cow disease</it> BSE Inquiry), concerning the use of animal byproducts in use during the licensed manufacture of medicines in the United Kingdom.  He stated that in a previous enquiry the Agency had been asked to:
<it>"... identify relevant manufacturers and obtain information about the bovine material contained in childrenâ€™s vaccines, the stocks of these vaccines and how long it would take to switch to other products."</it></p>
<p>

It was further reported that the:
<it>"... use of bovine insulin in a small group of mainly elderly patients was noted and it was recognised that alternative products for this group were not considered satisfactory."</it></p>
<p>

A medicines licensing committee report that same year recommended that: <it>"... no licensing action is required at present in regard to products produced from bovine material or using prepared bovine brain in nutrient media and sourced from outside the United Kingdom, the Channel Isles and the Republic of Ireland provided that the country of origin is known to be free of BSE, has competent veterinary advisers and is known to practise good animal husbandry."</it></p>
