A <b>police car</b> is the description for a vehicle used by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../627/23627.xml">
police</link>, to assist with their duties in patrolling and responding to incidents. Typical uses of a police car include transportation for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/310240.xml">
officers</link> to reach the scene of an incident quickly, to transport <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/5785.xml">
criminal</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../966/344966.xml">
suspect</link>s, or to patrol an area, while providing a high visibility <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../832/6090832.xml">
deterrent</link> to crime. Some police cars are specially adapted for work on busy roads.</p>
<p>

The first police car was a wagon run by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../3$00/Radeon_R$300.xml">
electricity</link> fielded on the streets of <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../842/129842.xml">
Akron, Ohio</link></village>
 in 1899.  The first operator of the police patrol wagon was Akron Police officer Louis Mueller, Sr.  It could reach 16 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../283/182283.xml">
miles per hour</link> and travel 30 miles before its battery needed to be recharged.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> The car was built by city mechanical engineer Frank Loomis. The $2,400 vehicle was equipped with electric lights, gongs and a stretcher. The car's first assignment was to pick up an intoxicated man at Main and Exchange streets.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

In some areas of the world, the police car has become more widely used than <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/310240.xml">
police officer</link>s "walking the beat".  This is because there has been a shift in the focus of policing away from high visibility with "an officer on every street corner" to more focused services, sending officers out in response to incidents, and also allowing patrols to cover a much greater area in less time. </p>
<p>

Advocates&#91;&#93; of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../277/1510277.xml">
community policing</link> often cite this shift in to vehicles, and away from face to face contact, as a reason for breakdowns in relations with the community. As such, these organizations often ask police departments to encourage constables to spend less time in their vehicles and more time walking the streets and interacting with the community. This has led to some countries and forces, such as those in the <autocracy wordnetid="108361001" confidence="0.8">

s, these cars are designed for the job of enforcing traffic laws, and as such usually have the highest performance of any of the police vehicles, as they must be capable of catching most other vehicles on the road. They may be fitted with special bumpers designed to force vehicles off the road, and may have visual and audible warnings, with special audible warnings which can be heard from a greater distance. In some police forces, the term "traffic car" may refer to cars specifically equipped for traffic control in addition to enforcing traffic laws. As such, these cars may differ only slightly from a patrol car, including having radar and laser speed detection equipment, traffic cones and flares, and traffic control signs.</entry>

, provide a "police package" option, which is built to police specifications in the factory. Police forces may add to these modifications by adding their own equipment and making their own modifications after purchasing a vehicle.</p>
<p>

Modifications a police car might undergo include adjustments for higher durability, speed, high mileage driving and long periods of idling at a higher temperature. This is usually accomplished by heavy duty <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../955/426955.xml">

 Audible and visual warnings </st>

<p>

Police vehicles are often fitted with audible and visual warning systems to alert other motorists of their approach or position on the road. In many countries, use of the audible and visual warnings affords the officer a degree of exemption from road traffic laws (such as the right to exceed speed limits, or to treat red stop lights as give way) and may also suggest a duty on other motorists to move out of the direction of passage of the police car or face possible prosecution.</p>
<p>

Visual warnings on a police car can be of two types&nbsp;— either <b>passive</b> or <b>active</b>.</p>

<ss2>

 Passive visual warnings </st>
<p>

Passive visual warnings are the markings on the vehicle. Police vehicle markings usually make use of bright colours or strong contrast with the base colour of the vehicle. Modern police vehicles in some countries have <equipment wordnetid="103294048" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<p>

Police vehicle marking schemes usually include the word "Police" or similar phrase (such as "State Trooper" or "Highway Patrol") or the force's crest. Some police forces use unmarked vehicles, which do not have any passive visual warnings at all.</p>

 Active visual warnings </st>

<p>

The active visual warnings are usually in the form of flashing coloured lights (also known as '<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../559/2843559.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22beacon+anchor%22])">
beacons</link>' or '<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../559/2843559.xml">
lightbar</link>s').  These flash in order to attract the attention of other road users as the police car approaches, or to provide warning to motorists approaching a stopped vehicle in a dangerous position on the road.  Common colours for police warning beacons are blue and red, however this often varies by force. Several types of flashing lights are used, such as <link>
rotating beacons</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../571/52571.xml">
halogen light</link>s, or <link>
light emitting diode</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/299593.xml">
strobe</link>s. Some police forces also use <link>
arrow stick</link>s to direct traffic, or message display boards to provide short messages or instructions to motorists. The headlights of some vehicles can be made to flash, or small strobe lights can be fitted in the headlight, tail light and indicator lights of the vehicle.</p>

In addition to visual warnings, most police cars are also fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../073/874073.xml">
siren</link>s, which can alert people and vehicles to the presence of an emergency vehicle before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the car. A later development was the rotating <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../753/142753.xml">
air siren</link>, which made noise when air moved past it. Most modern vehicles are now fitted with electronic sirens, which can produce a range of different noises. Police driving training often includes the use of different noises depending on traffic conditions and manoeuvre being performed. For instance, on a clear road, approaching a junction, the 'wail' setting may be used, which gives a long up and down variation, with an unbroken tone, whereas, in heavy slow traffic, a 'yelp' setting may be preferred, which is a sped up version of the 'wail'. Some vehicles may also be fitted with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../115/1800115.xml">
airhorn</link> audible warnings.</p>
<p>

A development is the use of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../112/225112.xml">
RDS</link> system of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../970/1149970.xml">
car radio</link>s, whereby the vehicle can be fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, in the manner of a traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into all RDS radios for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence, although is not able to alert pedestrians and non-RDS radio users.</p>

 Police cars in popular culture </st>

<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../685/1000685.xml">
Police chases</link> have been dramatized in television programs and movies, and occasionally feature in television news coverage of unusual circumstances, showing footage from an airborne camera.</p>
<p>

In film and television fiction, police cars are usually portrayed as containing a team of two police officers so that they may converse and interact on screen. In reality, most districts have only one police officer per vehicle, although at night this may increase to two.</p>
