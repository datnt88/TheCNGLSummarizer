<b>Low-carbohydrate diets</b> or <b>low-carb diets</b> are dietary programs that restrict <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/5932.xml">
carbohydrate</link> consumption usually for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../199/400199.xml">
weight control</link> or for the treatment of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../435/56435.xml">
obesity</link>.  Foods high in digestible carbohydrates (e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../969/36969.xml">
bread</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../871/23871.xml">
pasta</link>) are limited or replaced with foods containing a higher percentage of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../634/23634.xml">
proteins</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/11042.xml">
fat</link>s (e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../940/18940.xml">

<p>

<indent level="1">

<it>Low-carbohydrate diets restrict caloric intake by reducing the consumption of carbohydrates to 20 to 60 g per day (typically less than 20 percent of the daily caloric intake).

Some anthropologists believe that early humans were <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../098/210098.xml">

Dr. Robert Atkins</link> published <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/84121.xml">

<p>

In 1975, Walter Voegtlin published a book advocating a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../509/215509.xml">

In 1979, Dr Herman Tarnower published the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../782/341782.xml">

<p>

The concept of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../226/404226.xml">
glycemic index</link> was invented in 1981 by Dr. David Jenkins.  This concept evaluates foods according to their insulin demand -- with fast digesting simple carbohydrates having a high insulin demand and slower digesting complex carbohydrates such as grains having a lower insulin demand.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref></p>

<p>

In the 1990s Dr. Atkins published <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/84121.xml">
Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution</link> and other doctors began to publish books based on the same principles. This has been said to be the beginning of the "low carb craze."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref> During the late 1990s and early 2000s low-carbohydrate diets became some of the most popular diets in the U.S. (by some accounts as much as 18% of the population was using a low-carbohydrate diet at its peak<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref>) and spread to many countries. These were, in fact, noted by some food manufacturers and restaurant chains as substantially affecting their businesses (notably <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref>). This was in spite of the fact that the mainstream medical community continued to denounce low-carbohydrate diets as being a dangerous trend.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref> It is, however, valuable to note that many of these same doctors and institutions at the same time quietly began altering their own advice to be closer to the low-carbohydrate recommendations (e.g. eating more protein, eating more fiber/less starch, reducing consumption of juices by children).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref> The low-carbohydrate advocates did some adjustments of their own increasingly advocating controlling fat and eliminating <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../487/263487.xml">

The 1990s and 2000s also saw the publication of an increased number of clinical studies regarding the effectiveness and safety (pro and con) of low-carbohydrate diets (see <substance wordnetid="100020090" confidence="0.8">

After 2004 the popularity of this diet trend began to wane significantly although it still remains quite popular. In spite of the decline in popuarlity this diet trend has continued to quietly garner attention in the medical and nutritional science communities.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref></p>

The term <it>low-carbohydrate diet</it> today is most strongly associated with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/84121.xml">
Atkins Diet</link>. However, there is an array of other diets that share to varying degrees the same principles (e.g. the <substance wordnetid="100020090" confidence="0.8">

).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref> Therefore, there is no widely accepted definition of what precisely constitutes a low-carbohydrate diet. It is important to note that the level of carbohydrate consumption defined as low-carbohydrate by medical researchers may be different than the level of carbohydrate defined by diet advisors.  For the purposes of this discussion, we focus on diets that reduce (nutritive) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/5932.xml">
carbohydrate</link> intake sufficiently to dramatically reduce or eliminate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../895/14895.xml">
insulin</link> production in the body and to encourage <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/84139.xml">
ketosis</link> (production of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../803/16803.xml">
ketones</link> to be used as energy in place of glucose).</p>
<p>

Although originally low-carbohydrate diets were created based on anecdotal evidence of their effectiveness, today there is a much greater theoretical basis on which these diets rest.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2236%22])">36</ref> The key scientific principle which forms the basis for these diets is the relationship between consumption of carbohydrates and their effects on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../406/289406.xml">
blood sugar</link> (i.e. blood <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../950/12950.xml">
glucose</link>) and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../311/13311.xml">
hormone</link> production. Blood sugar levels in the human body must be maintained in a fairly narrow range to maintain health. The two primary hormones related to regulating blood sugar levels, produced in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../300/38300.xml">
pancreas</link>, are insulin, which lowers blood sugar levels, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../953/249953.xml">
glucagon</link>, which raises blood sugar levels.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref> In general, most <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../892/18984892.xml">
western</link> diets (and many others) are sufficiently high in nutritive carbohydrates that virtually every meal causes substantial insulin production and avoids <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/84139.xml">
ketosis</link>, thus causing excess energy in the diet to be stored as fat (discussed in the next section). By contrast, low-carbohydrate diets, or more properly, diets that are very low in nutritive carbohydrates, discourage insulin production and tend to cause ketosis. Some researchers suggest that this causes excess dietary energy and body fat to be eliminated from the body although this theory remains, at best, controversial.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2238%22])">38</ref></p>
<p>

Low-carbohydrate diet advocates in general recommend reducing nutritive carbohydrates (commonly referred to as "net carbs," i.e. grams of total carbohydrates reduced by the non-nutritive carbohydrates)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2239%22])">39</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2240%22])">40</ref> to very low levels. This means sharply reducing consumption of desserts, breads, pastas, potatoes, rice, and other sweet or starchy foods. Some recommend levels as low as 20-30 grams of "net carbs" per day, at least in the early stages of dieting<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2241%22])">41</ref> (for comparison, a single slice of white bread typically contains 15 grams of carbohydrate, almost entirely starch). By contrast, the <institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../259/431259.xml">
U.S. Institute of Medicine</link></academy>
</institution>
 recommends a minimum intake of 130 grams of carbohydrate per day (the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../107/11107.xml">
FAO</link> and <organization wordnetid="108008335" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../583/33583.xml">

 similarly recommend that the majority of dietary energy come from carbohydrates).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2242%22])">42</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2243%22])">43</ref> Low-carbohydrate diets often differ in the specific amount of carbohydrates allowed, whether certain types of foods are preferred, whether occasional exceptions are allowed, etc. Generally they all agree that processed sugar should be eliminated, or at the very least greatly reduced, and similarly generally discourage heavily processed grains (white bread, etc.). They vary greatly in their recommendations as to the amount of fat allowed in the diet although the most popular versions today (including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/84121.xml">
Atkins</link>) generally recommend at most a moderate fat intake.</p>
<p>

It has been argued by some low-carbohydrate proponents that it is the rise in carbohydrate consumption, especially refined carbohydrates, that has caused <it>epidemic</it> levels of many diseases in modern society.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2244%22])">44</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2245%22])">45</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2246%22])">46</ref></p>
<p>

As a related note, there is a set of diets known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../226/404226.xml">
low-glycemic-index diets</link> (low-GI diets) or low-glycemic-load diets (low-GL diets), in particular the Low GI Diet by Brand-Miller et al.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2247%22])">47</ref> In reality, low-carbohydrate diets are, literally speaking, low-GL diets (and vice versa) in that they specifically limit what contributes to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../264/1074264.xml">
glycemic load</link> in foods. In practice, though, "low-GI"/"low-GL" diets differ from "low-carb" diets in the following ways. First, low-carbohydrate diets treat all nutritive carbohydrates as having the same effect on metabolism and generally assume that their effect is independent of other nutrients in food. Low-GI/low-GL diets base their recommendations on the actual measured metabolic (glycemic) effects of the foods eaten. Second, as a practical matter, low-GI/low-GL diets generally do not recommend diets with glycemic loads low enough to minimize insulin production and induce ketosis, whereas low-carbohydrate diets generally do. </p>
<p>

Another related diet type, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../458/5816458.xml">
low-insulin-index diet</link>, is very similar except that it is based on measurements of direct insulemic responses (i.e. the amount of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../895/14895.xml">
insulin</link> in the bloodstream) to food rather than glycemic response (the amount of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../950/12950.xml">
glucose</link> in the bloodstream). Although the diet recommendations mostly involve lowering nutritive carbohydrates, there are some low-carbohydrate foods that are discouraged as well (e.g. beef).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2248%22])">48</ref></p>

 Ketosis and insulin synthesis: what is normal? </st>
<p>

At the heart of the debate about most low carbohydrate diets are fundamental questions about what is a <it>normal</it> diet and how the human body is supposed to operate. These questions can be summarized as follows. Nutritive carbohydrates (starches and sugars) in the diet tend to break down very easily into <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../950/12950.xml">
glucose</link> in the bloodstream (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../406/289406.xml">
blood sugar</link>) when consumed. Glucose in the blood is used by the cells in the body for energy for their basic function. Excessive amounts of glucose in the blood are toxic to the human body (the reason <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../677/44677.xml">

pancreas</link> automatically produces insulin to cause the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../301/17384301.xml">
liver</link> to convert glucose into <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../986/168986.xml">
glycogen</link> (glycogenesis) and triglycerides (which can become body fat), thus reducing the blood sugars to safe levels.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2249%22])">49</ref> Diets with a high starch/sugar content, therefore, cause sharp spikes in insulin production. As such the blood sugar levels are highly variable with every meal.</p>
<p>

By contrast, if the diet is very low in starches and sugars (low-carbohydrate diets) the blood sugar level can fall so low that there is insufficient glucose to fuel the cells in the body. This state causes the pancreas to produce <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../953/249953.xml">
glucagon</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2250%22])">50</ref> Glucagon causes the conversion of stored glycogen to glucose and, once the glycogen stores are exhausted, causes the liver to synthesize <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../556/56556.xml">

ketosis</link>) and glucose (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../671/248671.xml">
gluconeogenesis</link>) from fats and proteins, respectively. Most cells in the body can use ketones for energy instead of glucose, and since ketones are easier to produce, only a small amount of glucose is created (in other words, ketosis is the more significant process in this case). Because diets low in starches and sugars do not tend to directly affect blood sugar levels significantly, meals tend to have little direct effect on insulin levels (and so such diets tend to discourage insulin production in general).</p>

, contain significant amounts of starches (and, frequently, significant amounts of sugars). As such, the metabolisms of most westerners tend to operate outside of ketosis and tend to involve significant insulin production. This has been regarded by medical science in the last century as being <it>normal</it>. Ketosis has generally been regarded as a dangerous (potentially life-threatening) state which unnecessarily stresses the liver and causes destruction of muscle tissues. The view that has been developed is that getting energy more from protein than carbohydrates causes liver damage and that getting energy more from fats than carbohydrates causes <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../735/5069735.xml">
heart disease</link> and other health problems. This view is still the view of the majority in the medical and nutritional science communities.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2251%22])">51</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2252%22])">52</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2253%22])">53</ref></p>
<p>

Most advocates of low-carbohydrate diets (specifically those that recommend diets similar to the Atkins Diet) argue that maintaining a metabolic state where glucose is the primary energy source in the body is not normal at all and that the human body is, in fact, supposed to function primarily in ketosis.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2254%22])">54</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2255%22])">55</ref> They argue that high insulin levels can, in fact, cause many health problems, most significantly, fat storage and weight gain. They argue that the purported dangers of ketosis are unsubstantiated (some of the arguments against ketosis result from confusion between ketosis and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../792/537792.xml">
ketoacidosis</link> which is a related but very different process).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2256%22])">56</ref> They also argue that fat in the diet only contributes to heart disease in the presence of high insulin levels and that if the diet is instead adjusted to induce ketosis, fat and cholesterol in the diet are not a major concern (although most do not advocate unrestricted fat intake and do advocate avoiding <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../487/263487.xml">
trans fat</link>). Further it is argued that, whereas insulin in the bloodstream causes storage of food energy, when the body is in ketosis, excess ketones (which contain excess energy) are excreted in the urine and the breath.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2257%22])">57</ref></p>

Because of the substantial controversy regarding low-carbohydrate diets and even disagreements in interpreting the results of specific studies it is difficult to objectively summarize the research in a way that reflects scientific consensus.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2258%22])">58</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2259%22])">59</ref> Although there has been some research done throughout the twentieth century,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2260%22])">60</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2261%22])">61</ref> most directly relevant scientific studies have occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s and, as such, are relatively new.

However, studies are emerging which evaluate these diets over much longer periods, controlled studies as long as two years and survey studies as long as two decades.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2268%22])">68</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2262%22])">62</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2269%22])">69</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2270%22])">70</ref></p>
<p>

In addition to research on the efficacy of the diets some research has directly addressed other areas of health affected by low-carbohydrate diets. For example, contrary to popular belief that low-carbohydrate diets damage the heart, one study found that women eating low-carbohydrate, high-fat/protein diets had the same or slightly less risk of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../735/5069735.xml">

 Major governmental and medical organizations </st>
<p>

Although opinions regarding low-carbohydrate diets vary greatly through the medical and nutritional science communities, major government bodies as well as major medical and nutritional associations have generally opposed this nutritional regimen. However in recent years some of these same organizations have gradually begun to relax their opposition to the point that some have even voiced cautious support for low-carbohydrate diets though most still oppose them. The following are official statements from some of these organizations.

The AHA has been one of the most adamant opponents of low-carbohydrate diets.

Criticism and controversies</st>

<st>
 Water-related weight loss</st>
<p>

In the first week or two of a low-carbohydrate diet a great deal of the weight loss comes from eliminating water retained in the body (many doctors say that the presence of high levels of insulin in the blood causes unnecessary water retention in the body).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2293%22])">93</ref> However, this is a short-term effect and is entirely separate from the general weight loss that these diets can produce through eliminating excess body fat.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Exercise </st>
<p>

Some critics argue that low-carbohydrate diets can inherently cause weakness or fatigue<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2294%22])">94</ref> giving rise to the occasional assumption that low-carbohydrate dieting cannot involve an exercise regimen. Advocates of low-carbohydrate diets generally dispute any suggestion that such diets cause weakness or exhaustion (except in the first several days as the body adjusts) and indeed most highly recommend exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2293%22])">93</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2295%22])">95</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Vegetables and Fruits </st>
<p>

Many critics argue that low-carbohydrate diets inherently require minimizing vegetable and fruit consumption which in turn robs the body of important nutrients.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2296%22])">96</ref> Some critics imply or explicitly argue that vegetables and fruits are inherently all heavily concentrated sources of carbohydrates (so much so that some sources literally treat the words <it>vegetable</it> and <it>carbohydrate</it> as synonymous).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2297%22])">97</ref> This is, in fact, false. It is true that most fruits tend to have a significant concentration of sugar meaning that they can only be eaten in small quantities. But most vegetables are, in fact, low- or moderate-carbohydrate foods (note that in the context of these diets <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../558/140558.xml">
fiber</link> is excluded because it is not a nutritive carbohydrate). The vegetables that the average person tends to enjoy the most, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../501/23501.xml">
potato</link>es, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/36979.xml">
rice</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../397/20397.xml">
maize</link> (corn), and others, are typically those that have high concentrations of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../711/27711.xml">
starch</link> but these are, in reality, the exception not the rule. Most low-carbohydrate diet plans easily accommodate most vegetables such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../556/66556.xml">
broccoli</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../734/169734.xml">
spinach</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../331/164331.xml">
cauliflower</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../017/166017.xml">
avocado</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../995/38995.xml">
peppers</link>, etc.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2298%22])">98</ref> Nevertheless debate remains as to whether restricting even just high-carbohydrate fruits, vegetables, and grains is truly healthy.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2299%22])">99</ref></p>
<p>

It should be noted that, contrary to the recommendations of most low-carbohydrate diet guides, some individuals may choose to avoid vegetables altogether in order to minimize carbohydrates. It is more likely that such a diet could be nutritionally deficient. It should also be noted that low-carbohydrate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../591/32591.xml">
vegetarianism</link> can be and is practiced successfully.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22100%22])">100</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Micronutrients and vitamins </st>
<p>

The major low-carbohydrate diet guides generally recommend multi-vitamin and mineral supplements as part of the diet regimen which may lead some to believe that these diets are nutritionally deficient. The primary reason for this recommendation is that if the switch from a high-carbohydrate to a low-carbohydrate, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/299619.xml">
ketogenic</link> diet is rapid, the body can temporarily go through a period of adjustment during which the body may require extra vitamins and minerals (the reasons have to do with the body's releasing excess fluids that were stored during high-carbohydrate eating). In other words, the body goes through a temporary "shock" if the diet is changed to low-carbohydrate dieting quickly just as it would changing to a high-carbohydrate diet quickly. This does not, in and of itself, indicate that either type of diet is nutritionally deficient. While it is true that many foods that are rich in carbohydrates are also rich in vitamins and minerals, there are many low-carbohydrate foods that are similarly rich in vitamins and minerals.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22101%22])">101</ref> Also, the important <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/14538619.xml">
vitamin B12</link> is only available in significant quantities from animal sources and not from vegetable sources.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22102%22])">102</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Glucose availability </st>
<p>

A common argument in favor of high-carbohydrate diets is that most carbohydrates break down readily into glucose in the bloodstream and, therefore, the body does not have to work as hard to get its energy in a high-carbohydrate diet as a low-carbohydrate diet. This argument, by itself, omits certain salient details. Although most carbohydrates do break down readily into glucose, most of that glucose does not remain in the bloodstream for long. The excess glucose is toxic to the body and so insulin is produced in the pancreas to cause the body to convert most of the glucose to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../986/168986.xml">
glycogen</link> and fat for storage.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22103%22])">103</ref> So, in reality, some of the glucose used by the body on a high-carbohydrate diet must be explicitly converted from non-carbohydrate sources just as a low-carbohydrate diet produces both <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../803/16803.xml">
ketones</link> and small amounts of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. It is generally agreed that the low-carbohydrate diets tax the liver more in these processes than high-carbohydrate diets but there is significant disagreement as to how large the difference is and even more disagreement as to how much of a burden the liver can handle safely. It is also generally agreed that the high-carbohydrate diets tax the pancreas more and that higher insulin production (characteristic of high-carbohydrate diets) can be a risk factor for diabetes although the exact risks and burden on the pancreas are highly debated.</p>

<st>
Other controversies</st>
<p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../524/35524.xml">
2004</link>, the Canadian government ruled that foods sold in Canada could not be marketed with reduced or eliminated carbohydrate content as a selling point because reduced carbohydrate content was not determined to be a health benefit, and that existing "low carb" and "no carb" packaging would have to be phased out by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/36164.xml">
2006</link>.</p>
<p>

Some variants of low carbohydrate diets involve substantially lowered intake of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../554/66554.xml">
dietary fiber</link> which can result in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../509/168509.xml">
constipation</link> if not supplemented.  For example, this has been a criticism of the <artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">

</artifact>
 (note that today the Atkins diet is more clear about recommending a fiber supplement during Induction). Most advocates today argue that fiber is a "good" carbohydrate and in fact encourage a high-fiber diet.</p>
<p>

It has been hypothesized that a diet related change in blood acidity can lead to bone loss through a process called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../792/537792.xml">
ketoacidosis</link>, as mentioned earlier in this article. However ketoacidosis, which is often confused with ketosis, is an acute medical condition caused by extreme fasting or as a symptom of untreated diabetes, and is not likely to be induced by a proper low-carbohydrate diet. </p>

One of the occasional side effects of a ketogenic diet is a noticeable smell of ketones in the urine, perspiration, and breath.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22104%22])">104</ref> 
This is caused by the temporary metabolism of fatty-acid derived acetyl-coa into the ketone form, so that it may be released from the liver into the blood stream. The ketones are then re-assembled when they reach various body tissues to form acetyl-coa again, which is used as the precursor to energy.</p>

<it>Cutting out starchy foods, or any food group, can be bad for your health because you could be missing out on a range of nutrients.
