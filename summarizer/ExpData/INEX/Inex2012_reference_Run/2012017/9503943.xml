<b>Equine nutrition</b> is the feeding of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/13645.xml">
horse</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../544/218544.xml">
ponies</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../505/50505.xml">

donkey</link>s, and other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../229/10229.xml">
equine</link>s. Correct and balanced <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../525/21525.xml">
nutrition</link> is a critical component of proper <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../741/2957741.xml">
horse care</link>.<p>

Horses are non-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../806/246806.xml">
ruminant</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../568/44568.xml">
herbivores</link> of a type known as a "hind-gut fermentor."  This means that horses have only one stomach, as do humans.  However, unlike humans, they also have to digest plant fiber (largely <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../911/6911.xml">
cellulose</link>) that comes from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../847/3128847.xml">
grass</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/46593.xml">
hay</link>.  Therefore, unlike <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../806/246806.xml">
ruminant</link>s, who digest <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../558/140558.xml">
fiber</link> in plant matter by use of a multichambered <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../747/39747.xml">
stomach</link>, horses use microbial fermentation in a part of the digestive system known as the <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/99597.xml">
cecum</link></it> (or <it>caecum</it>) to break down the cellulose.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> </p>
<p>

In practical terms, horses prefer to eat small amounts of food steadily throughout the day, as they do in nature when <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../453/854453.xml">
grazing</link> on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/221932.xml">
pasture</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>  Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, it is important to remember the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities. </p>
<p>

The digestive system of the horse is somewhat delicate.  Horses are unable to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../763/852763.xml">
regurgitate</link> food, except from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../506/168506.xml">
esophagus</link>.  Thus, if they overeat or eat something poisonous, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/8507183.xml">
vomit</link>ing is not an option.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>  They also have a long, complex <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../366/59366.xml">
large intestine</link> and a balance of beneficial microbes in their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/99597.xml">
cecum</link> that can be upset by rapid changes in feed.  Because of these factors, they are very susceptible to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../548/1472548.xml">
colic</link>, which is a leading cause of death in horses.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>  Therefore, horses require clean, high-quality feed, provided at regular intervals, and may become ill if subjected to abrupt changes in their diets.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>  </p>
<p>

Horses are also sensitive to molds and toxins.  For this reason, they must never be fed contaminated fermentable materials such as lawn clippings.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>  Fermented <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../507/246507.xml">

Horses and other members of the <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../229/10229.xml">

Chewing and swallowing</st>
<p>

Digestion begins in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../603/9293603.xml">
mouth</link>.  First, the animal selects pieces of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/246828.xml">
forage</link> and picks up finer foods, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../700/6700.xml">

forage</link>, and food is ground up for swallowing by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../280/1416280.xml">

<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../506/168506.xml">
esophagus</link> carries food to the stomach. The esophagus enters the stomach at an acute angle, creating a one-way valve, with a powerful sphincter mechanism at the gastroesophageal junction, which is why horses cannot <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/8507183.xml">
vomit</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>  The esophagus is also the area of the digestive tract where horses may suffer from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../249/3387249.xml">

<st>
The stomach and small intestine</st>
<p>

Horses have a relatively small <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../747/39747.xml">
stomach</link> for their size, which limits the amount of feed that can be taken in at one time.  The average sized horse has a stomach with a capacity of only 4&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallons (15&nbsp;l), and works best when it contains about 2&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallons (7.6&nbsp;l). One reason continuous foraging or several small feedings per day are better than one or two large meals is because the stomach begins to empty when it is two-thirds full, whether the food in the stomach is processed or not.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../610/99610.xml">
small intestine</link> is 50 to 70 feet (15 to 21&nbsp;m) long and holds 10&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallons (38&nbsp;l) to 12&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallons (45&nbsp;l). This is the major digestive organ where 50 to 70 percent of all nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../092/86092.xml">

<st>
The cecum and large intestine</st>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/99597.xml">
cecum</link> is the first section of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../366/59366.xml">
large intestine</link>. It is also known as the "water gut" or "hind gut." It is a blind-ended pouch,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> about 4&nbsp;feet (1.2&nbsp;m) long that holds 7&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallons (26&nbsp;l) to 8&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallons (30&nbsp;l). The small intestine opens into the cecum, and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../911/6911.xml">
cellulose</link> plant <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../558/140558.xml">

The reason horses must have their diets changed slowly is so the microbes in the cecum are able to modify and adapt to the different chemical structure of new feedstuffs.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> Too abrupt a change in diet can cause <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../548/1472548.xml">

, small colon, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../671/19385671.xml">
rectum</link> make up the remainder of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../366/59366.xml">
large intestine</link>. The large colon is 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7&nbsp;m)  long and holds up to 20&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallons (76&nbsp;l) of semi-liquid matter.  Its main purpose is to absorb carbohydrates which were broken down from cellulose in the cecum. Due to its many twists and turns, it is a common place for a type of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../548/1472548.xml">

Nutrients</st>
<p>

Like all animals, equines require five main classes of nutrients to survive: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/33306.xml">
water</link>, energy (primarily in the form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/11042.xml">
fat</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/5932.xml">
carbohydrates</link>), <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../634/23634.xml">
protein</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../512/32512.xml">
vitamin</link>s, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../053/19053.xml">
minerals</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref></p>

<ss1>
<st>
Water</st>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/33306.xml">
Water</link> makes up between 62-68% of a horse's body weight and is essential for life.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref>  Horses can only live a few days without water,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> becoming dangerously dehydrated if they lose 8-10% of their natural body water.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> Therefore, it is critically important to provide access to a fresh, clean, and adequate supply of water.</p>
<p>

An average 1,000&nbsp;lb (450&nbsp;kg) horse drinks 10&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallons (38&nbsp;l) to 12&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallons (45&nbsp;l) of water per day, more in hot weather, when eating dry forage such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/46593.xml">
hay</link>, or when consuming high levels of salt, potassium, and magnesium.  Horses drink less water in cool weather or when on lush <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/221932.xml">
pasture</link>, which has a relatively higher water content. When under hard work, or if a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../279/4433279.xml">
mare</link> is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../279/250279.xml">
lactating</link>, water requirements may be as much as four times greater than normal.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> Though they need a great deal of water, horses spend very little time drinking; usually 1-8 minutes a day, spread out in 2-8 episodes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>
<p>

Water plays an important part in digestion. The forages and grains horses eat are mixed with saliva in the mouth to make a moist bolus that can be easily swallowed.  Therefore, horses produce up to 10&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallons (38&nbsp;l) or 85 lb. of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../420/204420.xml">
saliva</link> per day.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>

Nutritional sources of energy are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/11042.xml">
fat</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/5932.xml">
carbohydrate</link>s.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../634/23634.xml">

pregnant</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../279/250279.xml">
lactating</link> need increased energy and protein in their diet.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> However, if a horse has too much energy in its diet and not enough exercise, it can become too high-spirited and difficult to handle.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/11042.xml">
Fat</link> exists in low levels in plants and can be added to increase the energy density of the diet.

Horses that are not subjected to hard work or extreme conditions usually have more than adequate amounts of vitamins in their diet if they are receiving fresh, green, leafy forages.  Sometimes a vitamin supplement is needed when feeding low-quality hay, if a horse is under stress (illness, traveling, showing, racing, and so on), or not eating well.  Grain has a different balance of nutrients than forage, and so requires specialized supplementation to prevent an imbalance of vitamins and minerals.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

Calcium and phosphorus are needed in a specific ratio of between 1:1 and 2:1.  Adult horses can tolerate up to a 5:1 ratio, foals no more than 3:1.  A total ration with a higher ratio of phosphorus than calcium is to be avoided.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref> Over time, imbalance will ultimately lead to a number of possible bone-related problems such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../461/22461.xml">

Solid feeds are placed into three categories:  forages (such as hay and grass), concentrates (including grain or pelleted rations), and supplements (such as prepared vitamin or mineral pellets).

They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

Hay, particularly alfalfa, is sometimes compressed into pellets or cubes.  Processed hay can be of more consistent quality and is more convenient to ship and to store.  It is also easily obtained in areas that may be suffering localized hay shortages.  However, these more concentrated forms can be overfed and horses are somewhat more prone to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../249/3387249.xml">
choke</link> on them. On the other hand, hay pellets and cubes can be soaked until they break apart into a pulp or thick slurry, and in this state are a very useful source of food for horses with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../964/47964.xml">

Whole or crushed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../700/6700.xml">

Oat</link>s are the most popular <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../700/6700.xml">
grain</link> for horses. Oats have a lower digestible energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the equine digestive system. They are also more palatable and digestible than other grains.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../397/20397.xml">
Corn</link> (USA), or maize (British English), is the second most palatable grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../435/56435.xml">
obesity</link>, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> </p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../858/36858.xml">
Wheat</link> is generally not used as a concentrate.  However, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/489377.xml">

Most horses only need quality forage, water and a salt or mineral block.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> Grain or other concentrates are often not necessary.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>  But, when grain or other concentrates are fed, quantities must be carefully monitored. To do so, horse feed is measured by weight, not volume.  For example, 1&nbsp;lb (0.45&nbsp;kg) of oats has a different volume than 1&nbsp;lb (0.45&nbsp;kg) of corn.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> When continuous access to feed is not possible, it is more consistent with natural feeding behavior to provide three small feedings per day instead of one or two large ones.  However, even two daily feedings is preferable to only one.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> To gauge the amount to feed, a weight tape can be used to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of a horse's weight.  The tape measures the circumference of the horse's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../320/5596320.xml">
barrel</link>, just behind the withers and elbows, and the tape is calibrated to convert circumference into approximate weight.</p>
<p>

Actual amounts fed vary by the size of the horse, the age of the horse, the climate, and the work to which the animal is put.  In addition, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../942/12942.xml">
genetic</link> factors play a role.  Some animals are naturally <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../153/13480153.xml">

Feeding forages</st>
<p>

Equids always require forage.  When possible, nutritionists recommend it be available at all times, at least when doing so does not overfeed the animal and lead to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../435/56435.xml">
obesity</link>.  It is safe to feed a ration that is 100% forage<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> (along with water and supplemental salt), and any feed ration should be at least 50% forage.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> Hay with alfalfa or other legumes has more concentrated nutrition and so is fed in smaller amounts than grass hay, though many hays have a mixture of both types of plant.  </p>
<p>

When <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../129/10090129.xml">
beet pulp</link> is fed, a ration of 2 to 5 pounds is usually soaked in water for 3 to 4 hours prior to feeding in order to make it more palatable, and to minimize the risk of choke and other problems.  It is usually soaked in a proportion of one part beet pulp to two parts water.  Beet pulp is usually fed in addition to hay, but occasionally is a replacement for hay when fed to very old horses who can no longer chew properly.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> It is available in both pelleted and shredded form, pellets must be soaked significantly longer than shredded beet pulp.</p>
<p>

Some pelleted rations are designed to be a "complete" feed that contains both hay and grain, meeting all the horse's nutritional needs.  However, even these rations should have some hay or pasture provided, a minimum of a half-pound of forage for every 100 pounds of horse, in order to keep the digestive system functioning properly and to meet the horse's urge to graze.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref></p>
<p>

When horses graze under natural conditions, they may spend up to 18 hours per day doing so.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2238%22])">38</ref>  However, on modern irrigated pastures, they may have their nutritional needs for forage met in as little as three hours per day, depending on the quality of grass available.</p>
<p>

Recent studies address the level of various <link>
non-structural carbohydrate</link>s (NSC), such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../464/3984464.xml">
fructan</link>, in forages.  Too high an NSC level causes difficulties for animals prone to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../943/1580943.xml">
laminitis</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../768/7663768.xml">
equine polysaccharide storage myopathy</link> (EPSM).  NSC cannot be determined by looking at forage, but hay and pasture grasses can be tested for NSC levels.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2239%22])">39</ref></p>

Feeding concentrates</st>
<p>

Concentrates, when fed, are recommended to be provided in quantities no greater than 1% of a horse's body weight per day,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref> and preferably in two or more feedings.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>  If a ration needs to contain a higher percent of concentrates, such as that of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../711/74711.xml">
race horse</link>, bulky grains such as oats should be used as much as possible; a loose mass of feed helps prevent impaction colic.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2240%22])">40</ref> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../791/63791.xml">
Peptic ulcer</link>s are linked to a too-high concentration of grain in the diet, particularly noticed in modern racehorses, where some studies show such ulcers affecting up to 90% of all race horses.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2241%22])">41</ref> </p>
<p>

In general, the portion of the ration that should be grain or other concentrated feed is 0 to 10% grain for mature idle horses; between 20 to 70% for horses at work, depending on age, intensity of activity and energy requirements.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> Concentrates should not be fed to horses within one hour before or after a heavy workout.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Concentrates also need to be adjusted to level of performance.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> Not only can excess grain and inadequate exercise lead to behavior problems,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> it may also trigger <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/2018023.xml">
Equine Exertional Rhabdomyolysis</link>, or "tying up," in horses prone to the condition.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2240%22])">40</ref></p>

Access to water</st>
<p>

Horses normally require free access to all the fresh, clean <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/33306.xml">
water</link> they want, and to avoid dehydration, should not be kept from water longer than four hours at any one time.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2242%22])">42</ref> However, water may need to be temporarily limited in quantity when a horse is very hot after a heavy workout. As long as a hot horse continues to work, it can drink its fill at periodic intervals, provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources.  But when the workout is over, a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30—90 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time. However, dehydration is also a concern, so some water needs to be offered during the cooling off process.  A hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked.  Sometimes the thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout, which is another reason to offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>
<p>

Even a slightly dehydrated horse is at higher risk of developing impaction <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../548/1472548.xml">
colic</link>. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> Thus, it is especially important for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../336/48336.xml">
electrolytes</link> to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>

This is not only because they are smaller, but also, because they evolved under harsher living conditions than horses, they use feed more efficiently.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2243%22])">43</ref>  Ponies easily become <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../435/56435.xml">

<p>

It is important to track the weight of a pony carefully, by use of a weight tape.  Forages may be fed based on weight, at a rate of about 1 pound of forage for every 100 pounds.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2243%22])">43</ref>  Forage, along with water and a salt and mineral block, is all most ponies require.  If a hard-working pony needs concentrates, a ratio of no more than 30% concentrates to 70% forage is recommended.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref> Concentrates designed for horses, with added vitamins and minerals, will often provide insufficient nutrients at the small serving sizes needed for ponies. Therefore, if a pony requires concentrates, feed and supplements designed specially for ponies should be used.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2243%22])">43</ref>  In the UK, extruded pellets designed for ponies are sometimes called "pony nuts.".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref></p>

Donkeys and mules need less concentrated feed than horses
</caption>
</image>

Like ponies, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../505/50505.xml">
mule</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../526/55526.xml">
donkey</link>s are also very hardy and generally need less concentrated feed than horses.  Mules need less protein than horses and do best on grass hay with a vitamin and mineral supplement.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2245%22])">45</ref>  If mules are fed concentrates, they only need about half of what a horse requires.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2246%22])">46</ref> Like horses, mules require fresh, clean water, but are less likely to over-drink when hot.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2245%22])">45</ref></p>
<p>

Donkeys, like mules, need less protein and more fiber than horses. They do best when allowed to consume small amounts of food over long periods, as is natural for them in an arid climate. They can meet their nutritional needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought. If they are worked long hours or do not have access to pasture, they require hay or a similar dried forage, with no more than a 1:4 ratio of legumes to grass.  They also require salt and mineral supplements, and access to clean, fresh water.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2247%22])">47</ref>  Like ponies and mules, in a lush climate, donkeys are prone to obesity and are at risk of laminitis.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2248%22])">48</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Treats</st>
<p>

Many people like to feed horses special treats such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../739/5985739.xml">
carrot</link>s, sugar cubes, peppermint candies or specially manufactured horse "cookies."  Horses do not need treats, and due to the risk of colic or choke, many horse owners do not allow their horses to be given treats.  There are also behavioral issues that some horses may develop if given too many treats, particularly a tendency to bite if hand-fed, and for this reason many horse trainers and riding instructors discourage the practice.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2249%22])">49</ref></p>
<p>

However, if treats are allowed, carrots and compressed hay pellets are common, nutritious, and generally not harmful.  Apples are also acceptable, though it is best if they are first cut into slices.  Horse "cookies" are often specially manufactured out of ordinary grains and some added molasses.  They generally will not cause nutritional problems when fed in small quantities.   However, many types of human foods are potentially dangerous to a horse and should not be fed.  This includes bread products, meat products, candy, and carbonated or alcoholic beverages.  </p>
<p>

It was once a common practice to give horses a weekly <it>bran mash</it> of wheat bran mixed with warm water and other ingredients.  It is still done regularly in some places.  While a warm, soft meal is a treat many horses enjoy, and was once considered helpful for its laxative effect, it is not nutritionally necessary.  An old horse with poor teeth may benefit from food softened in water, a mash may help provide extra <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../561/177561.xml">
hydration</link>, and a warm meal may be comforting in cold weather, but horses have far more fiber in their regular diet than do humans, and so any assistance from bran is unnecessary. There is also a risk that too much wheat bran may provide excessive phosphorus, unbalancing the diet, and a feed of unusual contents fed only once a week could trigger a bout of colic.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>

Feed storage</st>
<p>

All hay and concentrated feeds must be kept dry and free of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../469/51469.xml">
mold</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../310/19337310.xml">
rodent</link> feces and other types of contamination that may cause illness in horses.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Feed kept outside or otherwise exposed to moisture can develop mold quite quickly.  Due to fire hazards, hay is often stored under an open shed or under a tarp, rather than inside a horse barn itself, but should be kept under some kind of cover.  Concentrates take up less storage space, are less of a fire hazard, and are usually kept in a barn or enclosed shed.  A secure door or latched gate between the animals and any feed storage area is critical.  Horses accidentally getting into stored feed and eating too much at one time is a common but preventable way that horses develop colic or laminitis.  (<it>see</it> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Illnesses+related+to+improper+feeding%22])">
Illnesses related to improper feeding</link> <it>below</it>)</p>
<p>

It is also important to never give a horse feed that was contaminated by the remains of a dead animal.  This is a potential source of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../142/40142.xml">
botulism</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2250%22])">50</ref> This is not an uncommon situation.  For example, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/18845.xml">
mice</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../410/3410.xml">
bird</link>s can get into poorly stored grain and be trapped; hay bales sometimes accidentally contain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../370/29370.xml">
snake</link>s, mice, or other small animals that were caught in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/46593.xml">

Feeding behavior</st>
<p>

Horses can become anxious or stressed if there are long periods of time between meals. They also do best when they are fed on a regular schedule; they are creatures of habit and easily upset by changes in routine.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>  When horses are in a herd, their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../641/5596641.xml">
behavior</link> is hierarchical;<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2251%22])">51</ref> the higher-ranked animals in the herd eat and drink first.  Low-status animals, who eat last, may not get enough food, and if there is little available feed, higher-ranking horses may keep lower-ranking ones from eating at all.  Therefore, unless a herd is on pasture that meets the nutritional needs of all individuals, it is important to either feed horses separately,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> or spread  feed out in separate areas to be sure all animals get roughly equal amounts of food to eat.  In some situations where horses are kept together, they may still be placed into separate herds, depending on nutritional needs; overweight horses are kept separate from thin horses so that rations may be adjusted accordingly.</p>
