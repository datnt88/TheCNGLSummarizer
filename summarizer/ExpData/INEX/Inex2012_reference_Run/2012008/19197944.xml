The beach is divided into three roughly equal lengths, known as <b>Saint Clair Beach</b>, <b>Middle Beach</b>, and <b>Saint Kilda Beach</b>. Access is easiest at the Saint Clair end, with steps and ramps down to the beach from Saint Clair Esplanade. The esplanade is the site of several cafes and restaurants. At its end, also the eastern end of the beach, is the Saint Clair salt-water swimming pool, the city’s oldest pool, opened in 1884<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. The pool has been upgraded on several occasions, most recently in 2002<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. A short walking track leads southwest from the pool to Second Beach, a small stony beach sitting at the bottom of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../534/43534.xml">
basalt</link> cliffs of Forbury Head.</p>
<p>

Saint Clair Beach is a popular <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../198/28198.xml">
surfing</link> venue, as well as having a patrolled swimming area. Shark nets have been deployed one kilometre out from the beach every summer since 1970<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>, making this a safe swimming area. Major surf lifesaving and surfing championships are regularly hosted at Saint Clair Beach. The western end of Saint Clair Beach is marked by a series of old wooden posts, the remains of an old breakwater.</p>
<p>

The other major access-point to the beach is at Saint Kilda, where a sandy slope leads down to the sea from the road. Here, too, is a patrolled swimming area. Between the two access points is Middle Beach. This is backed by a series of high dunes topped by a walkway linking Saint Clair Esplanade with the Sir James Barnes Lookout, which offers views across south Dunedin from above <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../993/18453993.xml">
Forbury Park Raceway</link>. Behind these dunes are several of the city’s sports grounds, notably Kettle Park. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../480/3600480.xml">
Ocean Beach Railway</link> runs through these parks from the Otago Model Engineering Club’s premises close to the Saint Kilda beach access point.</p>
<p>

In recent years the dunes have been subject to severe erosion, and measures have been taken by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../345/628345.xml">
Dunedin City Council</link> to reinforce them. This is not the first time that erosion has threatened properties along this stretch of Dunedin’s coast. Heavy seas during the 1890s and early 1900s caused loss of land close to Saint Clair, and the current esplanade is sited along the line of the first sea wall to be build along this stretch of coast, built between 1911 and 1913<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>.</p>

Despite being a well-frequented beach within an urban area, Ocean Beach is regularly visited by a wide array of wildlife. Both <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../514/910514.xml">
seals</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../462/910462.xml">
sea lions</link> are occasional visitors, as are <bird wordnetid="101503061" confidence="0.8">
