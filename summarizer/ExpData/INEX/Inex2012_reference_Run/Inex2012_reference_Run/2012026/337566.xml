A large number of observational studies have consistently demonstrated a U-shaped relation between alcohol consumption and total mortality.  This relation appears to hold in men and women who are middle aged or older. The lowest mortality occurs in those who consume one or two drinks per day. In teetotalers or occasional drinkers, the rates are higher than in those consuming one or two drinks per day. In persons who consume three or more drinks per day, total mortality climbs rapidly with increasing numbers of drinks per day.</p>

Moderate drinkers are less likely to suffer <link>
heart attack</link>s than total abstainers or heavy drinkers. The first scientific study of the relationship between alcohol consumption and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../385/85385.xml">
atherosclerosis</link> was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1904. A review of major heart disease studies has found that:</p>
<p>

"Alcohol consumption is related to total mortality in a U-shaped manner, where moderate consumers have a reduced total mortality compared with total non-consumers and heavy consumers"</p>

<p>

The risk of a heart attack among moderate drinkers with diabetes is 52 percent lower than among nondrinkers and that the risk of dying in the four years after a heart attack is 32 percent lower among those who were moderate drinkers in the year before the attack.</p>

Coronary Heart Disease</st>
<p>

Pearson reviewed the evidence supporting the effect of alcohol consumption on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../735/5069735.xml">
coronary heart disease</link> (CHD): "More than a dozen prospective studies have demonstrated a consistent, strong, dose-response relation between increasing alcohol consumption and decreasing incidence of CHD. The data are similar in men and women in a number of different geographic and ethnic groups. Consumption of one or two drinks per day is associated with a reduction in risk of approximately 30% to 50%. Studies of coronary narrowings defined by cardiac catheterization or autopsy show a reduction in atherosclerosis in persons who consume moderate amounts of alcohol. In general, the inverse association is independent of potential confounders, such as diet and cigarette smoking. Concerns that the association could be an artifact due to cessation of alcohol consumption in persons who already have CHD have largely been disproved."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref></p>
<p>

Another study found that when men increased their alcohol intake from very low to moderate, they significantly reduced their risk of coronary heart disease. The study monitored the health of 18,455 males for a period of seven years.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref></p>

For up to 16 years the doctors monitored the health of 8,867 men who did not smoke, were of normal weight, exercised at least 30-60 minutes per day, and ate a balanced healthful diet. Among these healthy men with healthy lifestyles, those who consumed anywhere from 1/2 to two alcoholic drinks of beer, wine or liquor per day had significantly decreased risk of heart attacks. Those who averaged slightly more (one to two drinks per day) had the lowest risk.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref></p>

"Compared with abstainers, consumption of more than 60 g of alcohol per day (i.e., over four standard drinks -- heavy drinking) was associated with an increased relative risk of total stroke, 1.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-1.93); ischemic stroke, 1.69 (95% CI, 1.34-2.15); and hemorrhagic stroke, 2.18 (95% CI, 1.48-3.20), while consumption of less than 12 g/d was associated with a reduced relative risk of total stroke, 0.83 (95%, CI, 0.75-0.91) and ischemic stroke, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67-0.96), and consumption of 12 to 24 g/d was associated with a reduced relative risk of ischemic stroke, 0.72 (95%, CI, 0.57-0.91).

Alzheimer’s disease</link>.

"In patients with mild cognitive impairment, up to 1 drink/day of alcohol or wine may decrease the rate of progression to dementia."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2256%22])">56</ref></p>
<p>

"…there is no medical rationale to advise people over 65 to quit drinking wine moderately, as this habit carries no specific risk and may even be of some benefit for their health. Advising all elderly people to drink wine regularly for prevention of dementia would be however premature at this stage."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2257%22])">57</ref></p>

"Researchers found that people who were heavy drinkers [defined as more than two drinks per day] developed Alzheimer’s 4.8 years earlier than those who
were not heavy drinkers."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2258%22])">58</ref></p>
<p>

"Of people who reported drinking alcohol in the past year, those who consumed at least one drink in the past week, compared with those who did not, were significantly less likely to have poor cognitive function. … However, the relations were weakened when social position was added to the model. The authors concluded that for middle-aged subjects, increasing levels of alcohol consumption were associated with better function regarding some aspects of cognition. Nonetheless, it is not proposed that these findings be used to encourage increased alcohol consumption."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2259%22])">59</ref></p>

<p>

Another study concluded:</p>
<p>

"After adjustment for age, education, and smoking status, men with CVD [cardiovascular disease]/diabetes and low-to-moderate alcohol intake had a significantly lower risk for poor cognitive function (MMSE £ 25) than abstainers (odds ratios of 0.3 for less than one drink and 0.2 for one to two drinks per day). Alcohol intake was not associated with cognitive decline. … Alcohol may result in an acute beneficial effect on cognitive function among those with CVD/diabetes. However, selection bias and unmeasured confounding should be of concern when evaluating these results."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2260%22])">60</ref></p>

<p>

A further study concluded, "We report a positive association between moderate alcohol intake among middle-aged men and subsequent cognitive performance in later life. However, it is possible that the health risks associated with drinking outweigh any potential benefits for many elderly persons.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2261%22])">61</ref></p>

<p>

A French study concluded: </p>
<p>

"Among men, neuropsychological test scores were not associated with alcohol consumption in either univariate or multivariate analysis; nor did
the proportion of high cognitive performers vary by alcohol consumption. In contrast, among women, significant positive associations between alcohol consumption and cognitive performance were observed for most tests in multivariate analysis. … These findings suggest that, among women, moderate alcohol consumption may have a beneficial effect on cognitive function.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2262%22])">62</ref></p>
<p>

"Abstainers have poorer cognitive function than light drinkers and further investigation is needed to determine what factors contribute to this."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2263%22])">63</ref> "A range of demographic and physical function measures were found to explain partially the finding of abstainers having lower cognitive test scores. The effects of independent variables were largest in the 60–64-year-old age group with a trend for physical variables such as lung function and grip strength to become more important in the older age groups. In the 20–24-year-olds, the majority of the effect remained unexplained. There is evidence that poorer cognitive test performance by abstainers reflects in part selection effects and poorer physical functioning, but does not appear to be due to mental or physical health conditions or personality."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2264%22])">64</ref></p>
<p>

A review states, "There is some evidence to suggest that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption (up to three alcoholic drinks a day, or between one and seven drinks a week) may reduce the risk of cognitive impairment in the elderly compared with those who abstain. Drinking in moderation may contribute to some brain atrophy, but it may also reduce the number of silent infarcts in the brain, a known risk factor for cognitive impairment. In addition, light drinking may reduce blood clotting and blood serum lipid levels, as well as stimulate acetylcholine production in the brain."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2265%22])">65</ref></p>

A study on the common cold found that "Greater numbers of alcoholic drinks (up to three or four per day) were associated with decreased risk for developing colds because drinking was associated with decreased illness following infection. However, the benefits of drinking occurred only among nonsmokers. … Although alcohol consumption did not influence risk of clinical illness for smokers, moderate alcohol consumption was associated with decreased risk for nonsmokers."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22111%22])">111</ref></p>

The NIAAA states that "Although epidemiologic studies have found a clear association between alcohol consumption and development of certain types of cancer, study findings are often inconsistent and may vary by country and by type of cancer."  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../250/58250.xml">
U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services’</link> National <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../531/30531.xml">

The  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../096/1705096.xml">
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</link> (NIAAA) reports that  "Although there is no evidence that alcohol itself is a carcinogen, alcohol may act as a cocarcinogen by enhancing the carcinogenic effects of other chemicals. For example, studies indicate that alcohol enhances tobacco's ability to stimulate tumor formation in rats (Garro &amp; Lieber). In humans, the risk for mouth, tracheal, and esophageal cancer is 35 times greater for people who both smoke and drink than for people who neither smoke nor drink (Blot <it>et al</it>.), implying a cocarcinogenic interaction between alcohol and tobacco-related carcinogens (Garro &amp; Lieber)."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22114%22])">114</ref>  One study determined that "3.6% of all cancer cases worldwide are related to alcohol drinking, resulting in 3.5% of all cancer deaths."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22115%22])">115</ref>  The NiAAA suggests that "considerable evidence suggests a connection between heavy alcohol consumption and increased risk for cancer, with an estimated 2 to 4 percent of all cancer cases thought to be caused either directly or indirectly by alcohol."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22114%22])">114</ref></p>
<p>

The WCRF panel report <it>Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer:  a Global Perspective</it> finds the evidence "convincing" that alcoholic drinks increase the risk of the following cancers: mouth, pharynx and larynx, oesophagus, colorectum (men), breast (pre- and
postmenopause).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22116%22])">116</ref></p>
