This article summarizes the recommended maximum intake (or 'safe limits') of alcohol as recommended by the health agencies of various governments. These recommendations are  varied, reflecting scientific uncertainty. The recommendations are distinct from legal restrictions that may apply in those countries.

 Guidelines are general in nature </st>

The guidelines are general guidelines applying to a 'typical' person. Those who are larger than average might be able to consume more. However, there are some people who should not consume alcohol, or limit their use to less than guideline amounts. These are:

Countries express alcohol intake in 'units' or 'standard drinks' when recommending alcohol intake. In ascending order of unit size:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>United Kingdom</b>: A 'unit' is 8g or 10 millilitres of alcohol. A unit is roughly equivalent to half a pint of ordinary strength beer, lager, or cider (3–4% alcohol by volume), or a small pub measure (25 ml) of spirits (40% alcohol by volume), or a standard pub measure (50 ml) of fortified wine such as sherry or port (20% alcohol by volume).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></entry>
