The purposeful production of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../043/18948043.xml">
alcoholic beverages</link> is common in many cultures and often reflects their cultural and religious peculiarities as much as their geographical and sociological conditions. <p>

Brewing</link> dates from the beginning of civilization in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../874/874.xml">
ancient Egypt</link> and alcoholic beverages were very important at that time. Symbolic of this is the fact that while many gods were local or familial, <belief wordnetid="105941423" confidence="0.8">
<deity wordnetid="109505418" confidence="0.8">

 was worshiped throughout the entire country. The Egyptians believed that this important god invented beer, a beverage that was considered a necessity of life; it was brewed in the home "on an everyday basis."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

Both beer and wine were deified and offered to gods. Cellars and wine presses even had a god whose <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../333/103333.xml">
hieroglyph</link> was a winepress. The ancient Egyptians made at least 17 types of beer and at least 24 varieties of wine. Alcoholic beverages were used for pleasure, nutrition, medicine, ritual, remuneration and funerary purposes. The latter involved storing the beverages in tombs of the deceased for their use in the after-life.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

Numerous accounts of the period stressed the importance of moderation, and these norms were both secular and religious. While Egyptians did not generally appear to define drunkenness as a problem, they warned against <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../204/272204.xml">
taverns</link> (which were often houses of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../915/15157915.xml">
prostitution</link>) and excessive drinking. After reviewing extensive evidence regarding the widespread but generally moderate use of alcoholic beverage, the nutritional biochemist and historian <link>
William J. Darby</link> makes a most important observation: all these accounts are warped by the fact that moderate users "were overshadowed by their more boisterous counterparts who added 'color' to history." Thus, the intemperate use of alcohol throughout history receives a disproportionate amount of attention. Those who abuse alcohol cause problems, draw attention to themselves, are highly visible and cause legislation to be enacted. The vast majority of drinkers, who neither experience nor cause difficulties, are not noteworthy. Consequently, observers and writers largely ignore moderation.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

 which date to about 7000 BC.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> This early drink was produced by fermenting rice, honey, and fruit.</p>
<p>

A variety of alcoholic beverages was used in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../862/5042862.xml">
China</link> since prehistoric times. Alcohol, known in Chinese as <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../972/14864972.xml">
Jiu</link></it> was considered a spiritual food rather than a material (physical) food, and extensive documentary evidence attests to the important role it played in the religious life. "In ancient times people always drank when holding a memorial ceremony, offering sacrifices to gods or their ancestors, pledging resolution before going into battle, celebrating victory, before feuding and official executions, for taking an oath of allegiance, while attending the ceremonies of birth, marriage, reunions, departures, death, and festival banquets."</p>
<p>

A Chinese imperial edict of about 1116 BC makes it clear that the use of alcohol in moderation was believed to be prescribed by heaven. Whether or not it was prescribed by heaven, it was clearly beneficial to the treasury. At the time of <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../334/19334.xml">

 (1254-1324) it was drunk daily and was one of the treasury's biggest sources of income.</p>
<p>

Alcoholic beverages were widely used in all segments of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../154/156154.xml">
Chinese society</link>, were used as a source of inspiration, were important for hospitality, were considered an antidote for fatigue, and were sometimes misused. Laws against making wine were enacted and repealed forty-one times between 1100 BC and AD 1400. However, a commentator writing around 650 BC asserted that people "will not do without beer. To prohibit it and secure total <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../546/18589546.xml">
abstinence</link> from it is beyond the power even of sages. Hence, therefore, we have warnings on the abuse of it."</p>

ns, and as early as 2,700 BC they worshiped a wine goddess and other wine deities. Babylonians regularly used both beer and wine as offerings to their gods. Around 1,750 BC, the famous <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../604/7604.xml">
Code of Hammurabi</link> devoted attention to alcohol. However, there were no penalties for drunkenness; in fact, it was not even mentioned. The concern was fair commerce in alcohol. Nevertheless, although it was not a crime, it would appear that the Babylonians were critical of drunkenness.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

Greece</st>
<p>

While the art of wine making reached the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../041/9411041.xml">
Hellenic</link> peninsula by about 2,000 BC, the first alcoholic beverage to obtain widespread popularity in what is now Greece was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../743/37743.xml">
mead</link>, a fermented beverage made from honey and water. However, by 1,700 BC, wine making was commonplace, and during the next thousand years wine drinking assumed the same function so commonly found around the world: It was incorporated into religious rituals, it became important in hospitality, it was used for medicinal purposes and it became an integral part of daily meals. As a beverage, it was drunk in many ways: warm and chilled, pure and mixed with water, plain and spiced.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

Contemporary writers observed that the Greeks were among the most temperate of ancient peoples. This appears to result from their rules stressing moderate drinking, their praise of temperance, and their avoidance of excess in general. An exception to this ideal of moderation was the cult of <deity wordnetid="109505418" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../325/63325.xml">

, in which intoxication was believed to bring people closer to their deity.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

While habitual drunkenness was rare, intoxication at banquets and festivals was not unusual. In fact, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../933/1053933.xml">
symposium</link>, a gathering of men for an evening of conversation, entertainment and drinking typically ended in intoxication. However, while there are no references in ancient Greek literature to mass drunkenness among the Greeks, there are references to it among foreign peoples. By 425 BC, warnings against intemperance, especially at symposia, appear to become more frequent.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

<p>

From this period through at least the beginning of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../570/34570.xml">
eighteenth century</link>, attitudes toward drinking were characterized by a continued recognition of the positive nature of moderate consumption and an increased concern over the negative effects of drunkenness. The latter, which was generally viewed as arising out of the increased self-indulgence of the time, was seen as a threat to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../387/28387.xml">

<p>

In spite of the ideal of moderation, consumption of alcohol was often high. In the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../568/34568.xml">

However, the production and distribution of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../497/1318497.xml">

abbey</link>. Around 1668, he used strong bottles, invented a more efficient cork (and one that could contain the effervescence in those strong bottles), and began developing the technique of blending the contents. However, another century would pass before problems, especially bursting bottles, would be solved and sparkling champagne would become popular.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

grain</link> spirit, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../153/33153.xml">

The first confirmed written record of whisky comes from 1405 in Ireland, the production of whisky from malted barley is first mentioned in Scotland in an entry on the 1494, although both countries could have distilled grain alcohol before this date. </p>
<p>

Distilled spirit was generally flavored with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../104/170104.xml">
juniper</link> berries. The resulting beverage was known as jenever, the <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../433/8433.xml">
Dutch</link></language>
 word for "juniper." The French changed the name to genievre, which the English changed to "geneva" and then modified to "gin."  Originally used for medicinal purposes, the use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../988/12988.xml">
gin</link> as a social drink did not grow rapidly at first. However, in 1690, England passed "An Act for the Encouraging of the Distillation of Brandy and Spirits from Corn" and within four years the annual production of distilled spirits, most of which was gin, reached nearly one million gallons.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. It should be noted that at that time "corn" in England meant "grain" in general.</p>
<p>

The dawn of the eighteenth century saw the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../964/13964.xml">
British Parliament</link> pass legislation designed to encourage the use of grain for distilling spirits. In 1685, consumption of gin had been slightly over one-half million gallons but by 1714 it stood at two million gallons. In 1727, official (declared and taxed) production reached five million gallons; six years later the London area alone produced eleven million gallons of gin.
The English government actively promoted gin production to utilize surplus grain and to raise revenue. Encouraged by public policy, very cheap spirits flooded the market at a time when there was little stigma attached to drunkenness and when the growing urban poor in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../867/17867.xml">
London</link></village>
 sought relief from the newfound insecurities and harsh realities of urban life. Thus developed the so-called Gin Epidemic.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

While the negative effects of that phenomenon may have been exaggerated, Parliament passed legislation in 1736 to discourage consumption by prohibiting the sale of gin in quantities of less than two gallons and raising the tax on it dramatically. However, the peak in consumption was reached seven years later, when the nation of six and one-half million people drank over 18 million gallons of gin. And most was consumed by the small minority of the population then living in London and other cities; people in the countryside largely consumed beer, ale and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../253/19614253.xml">
cider</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

After its dramatic peak, gin consumption rapidly declined. From 18 million gallons in 1743, it dropped to just over seven million gallons in 1751 and to less than two million by 1758, and generally declined to the end of the century. A number of factors appear to have converged to discourage consumption of gin. These include the production of higher quality beer of lower price, rising corn prices and taxes which eroded the price advantage of gin, a temporary ban on distilling, an increasing criticism of drunkenness, a newer standard of behavior that criticized coarseness and excess, increased <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../969/29969.xml">
tea</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../727/604727.xml">
coffee</link> consumption, an increase in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../895/49895.xml">
piety</link> and increasing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../545/210545.xml">
industrialization</link> with a consequent emphasis on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../424/872424.xml">
sobriety</link> and labor efficiency.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

While drunkenness was still an accepted part of life in the eighteenth century, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../571/34571.xml">
nineteenth century</link> would bring a change in attitudes as a result of increasing industrialization and the need for a reliable and punctual work force. Self-discipline was needed in place of self-expression, and task orientation had to replace relaxed conviviality. Drunkenness would come to be defined as a threat to industrial efficiency and growth.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

Problems commonly associated with industrialization and rapid urbanization were also attributed to alcohol. Thus, problems such as urban crime, poverty and high infant <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../221/8221.xml">
mortality</link> rates were blamed on alcohol, although "it is likely that gross overcrowding and unemployment had much to do with these problems." Over time, more and more personal, social and religious/moral problems would be blamed on alcohol. And not only would it be enough to prevent drunkenness; any consumption of alcohol would come to be seen as unacceptable. Groups that began by promoting the moderate use of alcohol instead of its abuse- would ultimately form <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/76293.xml">
temperance movement</link>s and press for the complete and total <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../856/24856.xml">
prohibition</link> of the production and distribution of beverage alcohol. Unfortunately, this would not eliminate social problems but would compound the situation by creating additional problems wherever it was implemented.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

.  While this may seem strange for Puritans viewed from the modern context, it should be understood that drinking wine and beer at that time was safer than water - which was usually taken from sources used to dispose of sewerage and garbage.  Their experience showed them that it was safer to drink alcohol than the typically polluted water in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../239/9239.xml">
Europe</link>. Alcohol was also an effective <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../ury/23rd_century.xml">

 ancestors had consumed beer and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../603/19278603.xml">
ale</link>. Both in England and in the New World, people of both sexes and all ages typically drank beer with their meals. Because importing a continuing supply of beer was expensive, the early settlers brewed their own. However, it was difficult to make the beer they were accustomed to because wild <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../385/34385.xml">

, hop seeds were ordered from England in order to cultivate an adequate supply for traditional beer. In the meantime, the colonists improvised a beer made from red and black <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../718/170718.xml">

Beer was designated X, XX, or XXX according to its <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../309/409309.xml">

. The cost of rum dropped after the colonists began importing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../794/58794.xml">

Boston</link>. It was highly successful and within a generation the production of rum became colonial New England's largest and most prosperous industry. Almost every important town from <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 to the Carolinas had a rum distillery to meet the local demand, which had increased dramatically. Rum was often enjoyed in mixed drinks, including flip. This was a popular winter beverage made of rum and beer sweetened with sugar and warmed by plunging a red-hot fireplace poker into the serving mug.
Alcohol was viewed positively while its abuse was condemned. <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

drunkenness</link>: "Drink is in itself a good creature of God, and to be received with thankfulness, but the abuse of drink is from Satan; the wine is from God, but the drunkard is from the Devil." </p>
