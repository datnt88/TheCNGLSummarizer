A <b>banknote</b> (often known as a <b>bill</b>, <b>paper money</b> or simply a <b>note</b>) is a kind of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../722/1160722.xml">
negotiable instrument</link>, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../501/1006501.xml">
promissory note</link> made by a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../669/19360669.xml">
bank</link> payable to the bearer on demand, used as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/8983183.xml">
money</link>, and in many jurisdictions is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../793/267793.xml">
legal tender</link>.  Along with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../558/7558.xml">
coin</link>s, banknotes make up the cash or bearer forms of all modern <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/8983183.xml">
money</link>. With the exception of non-circulating high-value or precious metal commemorative issues, coins are generally used for lower valued monetary units, while banknotes are used for higher values.</p>

<sec>
<st>
Advantages</st>
<p>

Originally, precious and semi-precious metals were formed into coins and were used to negotiate and settle trades. Banknotes offer an alternative bearer form of money, but the advantages and disadvantages between the two forms of bearer money are complex and so in different circumstances the overall advantage can lie with either form.</p>
<p>

The costs of using bearer money include:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Manufacturing or issue costs. Coins are produced by industrial manufacturing methods that process the precious or semi-precious metals, and require additions of alloy for hardness and wear resistance. By contrast bank notes are printed paper (or polymer), and typically have a lower cost of issue, especially in larger denominations, compared to coin of the same value.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Wear costs. Coins wear and lose mass over their economic life, and eventually are scrapped. Banknotes do not lose economic value by wear, since, even if they are in poor condition, they are still a legally valid claim on the issuing bank. However, banks of issue do have to pay the cost of replacing banknotes in poor condition.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Opportunity cost of capital. Coins have economic value and are a form of non-financial capital, however they do not pay interest. Banknotes have economic value but are a form of financial capital, a loan to the issuing bank. The issuing bank invests its assets primarily in interest bearing loans and securities, but also needs to hold metallic reserves. Thus banknotes indirectly earn interest through the investments made by the issuing bank, but coins do not pay interest to anyone. This foregone interest is the most important economic advantage of banknotes over coins.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Cost of transport. Coins can be expensive to transport for high value transactions, but banknotes can be issued in large denominations that are lighter than the equivalent value in coins.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Cost of acceptance. Coins can be checked for authenticity by weighing and other forms of examination and testing. These costs can be significant, but good quality coin design and manufacturing can help reduce these costs. Banknotes also have an acceptance cost, the costs of checking the banknote's security features and confirming acceptability of the issuing bank.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The different advantages and disadvantages between coins and banknotes imply that there may be an ongoing role for both forms of bearer money, each being used where its advantages outweigh its disadvantages.</p>

<sec>
<st>
Convertibility</st>
<p>

The ability to exchange a note for some other kind of value is called "convertibility".  For example a US silver certificate was "payable in silver on demand" from the treasury until 1965. If a note is payable on demand for a fixed unit, it is said to be fully convertible to that unit. Limited convertibility occurs when there are restrictions in the time, place, manner or amount of exchange. </p>
<p>

A common misconception is that a bank note that is inconvertible is necessarily unbacked (so-called "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../911/175911.xml">
fiat money</link>"). Most of the confusion centers around the failure to distinguish between two types of  convertibility:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Physical convertibility, where a unit of currency can be exchanged at the issuing bank for a given physical amount of something, and</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Financial convertibility, where a unit of currency can be exchanged at the issuing bank for a unit's worth of the bank's assets.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The importance of financial convertibility can be seen by imagining that people in a community one day find themselves with more paper currency than they wish to hold — for example, when the main shopping season has ended. If the paper currency is physically convertible (for one ounce of silver, let us suppose), people will return the unwanted paper currency to the bank in exchange for silver, but the bank could head off this demand for silver by selling some of its own bonds to the public in exchange for its own paper currency. For example, if the community has 100 units of unwanted paper money, and if people intend to redeem the unwanted 100 units for silver at the bank, the bank could simply sell 100 units worth of bonds or other assets in exchange for 100 units of its own paper currency. This will soak up the unwanted paper and head off people's desire to redeem the 100 units for silver.</p>
<p>

Thus, by conducting this type of open market operation — selling bonds when there is excess currency and buying bonds when there is too little — the bank can maintain the value of the paper currency at one ounce of silver without ever redeeming any paper currency for silver. In fact, this is essentially what all modern central banks do, and the fact that their currencies might be physically inconvertible is made irrelevant by the maintenance of financial convertibility. Note that financial convertibility cannot be maintained unless the bank has sufficient assets to back the currency it has issued. Thus, it is an illusion that any physically inconvertible currency is necessarily also unbacked.</p>

<st>
History</st>
<p>

Paper money originated in two forms:  drafts, which are receipts for value held on account, and "bills", which were issued with a promise to convert at a later date. </p>
<p>

Money is based on the coming to pre-eminence of some commodity as payment. The oldest monetary basis was for agricultural capital: cattle and grain.  In Ancient <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../189/20189.xml">
Mesopotamia</link>, drafts were issued against stored grain as a unit of account. A "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../347/8347.xml">
drachma</link>" was a weight of grain.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../573/15573.xml">
Japan</link>'s feudal system was based on rice per year &ndash; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../170/404170.xml">
koku</link>. </p>
<p>

At the same time, legal codes enforced the payment for injury in a standardized form, usually in precious metals. The development of money then comes from the role of agricultural capital and precious metals having a privileged place in the economy. </p>
<p>

Such drafts were used for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../893/923893.xml">
giro</link> systems of banking as early as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../715/2252715.xml">
Ptolemaic Egypt</link> in the first century BC. </p>
<p>

The perception of banknotes as money has evolved over time.  Originally, money was based on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../211/180211.xml">
precious metals</link>.  Banknotes were seen as essentially an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../474/297474.xml">
I.O.U.</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../501/1006501.xml">
promissory note</link>:  a promise to pay someone in precious metal on presentation (see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../266/48266.xml">
representative money</link>). With the gradual removal of precious metals from the monetary system, banknotes evolved to represent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../320/50320.xml">
credit money</link>, or (if backed by the credit of a government) also <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../911/175911.xml">
fiat money</link>. </p>

The use of paper money as a circulating medium is intimately related to shortages of metal for coins. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../760/5760.xml">
ancient China</link> coins were circular with a rectangular hole in the middle. Several coins could be strung together on a rope. Merchants in China, if they became rich enough, found that their strings of coins were too heavy to carry around easily. To solve this problem, coins were often left with a trustworthy person, and the merchant was given a slip of paper recording how much money he had with that person. If he showed the paper to that person he could regain his money. Eventually from this paper money "<standard wordnetid="107260623" confidence="0.8">

, short of copper for striking coins, issued the first generally circulating notes. A note is a promise to redeem later for some other object of value, usually <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/8983183.xml">
specie</link>. The issue of credit notes is often for a limited duration, and at some discount to the promised amount later. The jiaozi nevertheless did not replace coins during the Song Dynasty; paper money was used alongside the coins.</p>

The original notes during the Yuan Dynasty were restricted in area and duration as in the Song Dynasty, but in the later course of the dynasty, facing massive shortages of specie to fund their ruling in China, began printing paper money without restrictions on duration.

 ended paper money, and closed much of Chinese trade.</p>
<p>

Ming Dynasty notes are the earliest surviving paper money, of which the 1 Kuan is the most common. The note, 220mm x 340mm, is also one of the world's largest banknotes.</p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../239/9239.xml">

 during the Spanish siege of 1574.  Over 5000 of the estimated 14,000 residents of Leyden died, mostly due to starvation.  Even leather (often used to create emergency currency) was boiled and used to feed the people.  So to create currency, the residents took covers and paper from hymnals and church missives and created paper planchets, which were struck using the same dies that were previously used to mint coins.  </p>

 was the first of the colonies to issue permanently circulating banknotes.  The use of fixed denominations and printed banknotes came into use in the 18th century.</p>
<p>

In the early 1700s each of the thirteen colonies issued their own banknotes (colonial currency). Later, the Continental Congress issued continental currency to support the revolutionary war. The United States government did not print banknotes until 1862. However, almost immediately after adoption of the Constitution in 1789, Congress chartered the first Bank of the United States and authorized it to issue banknotes. The bank served as quasi central bank of the United States. The bank closed in 1811 when Congress failed to renew its charter. In 1816, Congress chartered the second Bank of the United States. When its charter expired in 1836, the bank continue to operate under a charter granted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania until 1841.   </p>
<p>

In the United States, public acceptance of banknotes in replacement of precious metals was hastened in part by <order wordnetid="107168623" confidence="0.8">

Issue of banknotes</st>
<p>

Generally, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../666/5666.xml">
central bank</link> or treasury is solely responsible within a state or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../040/714040.xml">
currency union</link> for the issue of banknotes. However, this is not always the case, and historically the paper currency of countries was often handled entirely by private banks. Thus, many different banks or institutions may have issued banknotes in a given country. </p>
<p>

In a small number of countries, private banknote issue continues to this day. For example, by virtue of the complex constitutional setup in the <autocracy wordnetid="108361001" confidence="0.8">

Paper banknotes</st>

<p>

Most banknotes are made of dense 80 to 90 grams per square meter <link>
starch paper</link> (see also <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../908/16861908.xml">
paper</link>),  sometimes mixed with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/56212.xml">
linen</link>, abaca, or other textile fibres.  Generally, the paper used is different from ordinary paper:  it is much more resilient, resists wear and tear, and also does not contain the usual agents that make ordinary paper glow slightly under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../990/31990.xml">
ultraviolet</link> light. </p>
<p>

Early Chinese banknotes were printed on paper made of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/168010.xml">
mulberry</link> bark and this fibre is used in Japanese banknote paper today.</p>
<p>

Unlike most printing and writing paper, banknote paper is impregnated with polyvinyl alcohol or gelatin to give it extra strength.</p>
<p>

Most banknotes are made using the mould made process in which a watermark and thread is incorporated during the paper forming process.</p>
<p>

The thread is a simple looking security component found in most banknotes. It is however often rather complex in construction comprising fluorescent, magnetic, metallic and micro print elements. By combining it with watermarking technology the thread can be made to surface periodically on one side only. This is known as windowed thread and further increases the counterfeit resistance of the banknote paper. This process was invented by Portals, part of the <idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

. Cornerstone uses watermarking to reduce the number of corner folds by strengthening this part of the note. Platinum is a special coating to reduce the dirt picked up by banknotes. Optiks is a new thread based security feature that creates a plastic window in the paper which is very hard to copy.</p>

Durable banknote papers</st>

<p>

Banknote paper with enhanced durability is a recent development, designed to meet the growing need for popular low-denomination banknotes to withstand extreme wear.</p>
<p>

<b>Improved protection against dirt:</b> Manufacturers of banknote paper were quick to recognize the problems associated with dirt and developed a special paper with a thin layer of varnish on the surface to repel soiling. This layer is applied directly to the substrate. The thickness and structure of the paper remain unchanged, thereby preserving the natural feel. The so-called <b>Durable Banknote Papers</b>, which are available in the global banknote market under brand names, such as <it>LongLife, Platinum, Marathon Coated, Diamone</it>, and <it>Flesure</it>, protect banknotes from soiling and environmental incluences, making it possible for them to remain in circulation for longer. </p>
<p>

<b>Increased mechanical stability:</b> With new products, such as <it>Synthec</it> and <it>Diamone Composite</it>, banknote manufacturers have gone a step further and responded to the growing demand for higher mechanical stability of the paper—because the longer a banknote stays in circulation, the limper it becomes and the more easily it tears. <it>Synthec</it> substrate, for example, consists of 80 percent cotton fiber and 20 percent synthetic fiber, with the latter being longer and more flexible than the former. The synthetic fibers constitute a dense network within the cotton fiber structure, supporting the banknote like a kind of corset and increasing its mechanical stability. This practically doubles the useful life of the product. <it>Synthec</it> is much less sensitive to climate fluctuations than standard banknote paper. The synthetic fibers are incorporated in the banknote substrate at the sheet formation stage. This has the advantage that all established security features—such as three dimensional watermarks, fluorescent fibers, security threads, or the innovative new <it>varifeye</it> see-through window—can be integrated into the new <it>Synthec</it> substrate, just as they would be with the standard cotton substrate. Optically variable effect inks and foil elements, such as holograms, can be applied to this substrate in the same way as with traditional banknote paper. Public confidence in the established security features, built up over decades, remains intact. To ensure that the banknotes are also protected against dirt, they are given a standard coating of varnish. By the end of 2007, <it>Synthec</it> banknotes will be circulating in three countries, including an African country with different climate zones that has chosen <it>Synthec</it> as a substrate for its lowest-denomination note. In the south of the country conditions are tropical, with a rainy season that lasts for eight months, while the north is very arid and extremely hot, with temperatures reaching 41 degrees Celsius.</p>

Counterfeiting and security measures on paper banknotes</st>
<p>

The ease with which paper money can be created, by both legitimate authorities and counterfeiters, has led both to a temptation in times of crisis such as war or revolution to produce paper money which was not supported by precious metal or other goods, thus leading to hyperinflation and a loss of faith in the value of paper money, e.g. the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../002/2592002.xml">

 issued the world's first hybrid paper-polymer banknote.</p>
<p>

Polymer banknotes were developed to improve durability and prevent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../662/205662.xml">
counterfeit</link>ing through incorporated security features, such as optically variable devices that are extremely difficult to reproduce.</p>
<p>

The uptake of polymer banknotes has been strong with over 28 countries on all continents now using this innovative material. With strong durability and a high degree of security, polymer notes are becoming extremely popular.  Countries such as Vietnam, Brunei, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Romania have all their circulating banknotes on polymer.</p>

Other materials</st>
<p>

Over the years, a number of materials other than paper have been used to print banknotes.  This includes various textiles, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/51510.xml">
silk</link>, and materials such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../062/18062.xml">
leather</link>.  </p>
<p>

Silk and other fibers have been commonly used in the manufacture of various banknote papers, intended to provide both additional durability and security.  <link>
Crane and Company</link> patented banknote paper with embedded silk threads in 1844 and has supplied paper to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../667/53667.xml">
United States Treasury</link> since 1879.  Banknotes printed on pure silk "paper" include "emergency money" (<it>Notgeld</it>) issues from a number of German towns in 1923 during a period of fiscal crisis and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../681/13681.xml">

Vending machines and banknotes</st>
<p>

People are not the only economic actors who are required to accept banknotes. In the late twentieth century machines were designed to recognize banknotes of the smaller values long after they were designed to recognize coins distinct from slugs. This capability has become inescapable in economies where <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../286/38286.xml">
inflation</link> has not been followed by introduction of progressively larger coin denominations (such as the United States, where several attempts to introduce <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../778/374778.xml">
dollar coins</link> in general circulation have largely failed). The existing infrastructure of such machines presents one of the difficulties in changing the design of these banknotes to make them less counterfeitable, that is, by adding additional features so easily discernible by people that they would immediately reject banknotes of inferior quality, for every machine in the country would have to be updated.</p>

Destruction</st>
<p>

Banknotes have a limited lifetime, after which they are collected for destruction, usually recycling or shredding. A banknote is removed from the money supply by banks or other financial institutions due to everyday <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../006/1822006.xml">
wear and tear</link> from its handling. Banknote bundles are passed through a sorting machine that determines whether a particular note needs to be shredded, or are removed from the supply chain by a human inspector if they are deemed unfit for continued use – for example, if they are mutilated or torn. Counterfeit banknotes are destroyed unless they are needed for evidentiary or forensic purposes.</p>
<p>

Contaminated banknotes are also decommissioned. A Canadian government report indicates:</p>

These are removed from circulation primarily to prevent the spread of diseases.</p>

When taken out of circulation, Australian bank notes are melted down and mixed together to form plastic garbage bins.</p>

Paper money collecting as a hobby</st>
<p>

Banknote collecting, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../666/540666.xml">
Notaphily</link>, is a rapidly growing area of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/38212.xml">
numismatics</link>. Although generally not as widespread as coin and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../742/26742.xml">
stamp collecting</link>, the hobby is increasingly expanding.  Prior to the 1990s, currency collecting was a relatively small adjunct to coin collecting, but the practice of currency auctions, combined with larger public awareness of paper money have caused a boom in interest and values of rare banknotes.</p>
<p>

In the 1950s, Robert Friedberg published the landmark book <it>Paper Money of the United States</it>.  Friedberg devised an organizing number system of all types of U.S. banknotes; the system is widely accepted among collectors and dealers to this day, and the volume has been regularly updated.</p>
<p>

Another pioneer of cataloguing banknotes was Albert Pick, a well-known German <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../666/540666.xml">
notaphilist</link> (born 15 May 1922 in Cologne) who published a number of catalogs of European paper money, and, in 1974, the first <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../508/12723508.xml">
Standard Catalog of World Paper Money</link></it>.  His collection of over 180,000 banknotes was eventually housed at the Bavarian Mortgages and Exchange Bank (Bayerischen Hypotheken- und Wechselbank, now <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../024/2092024.xml">
HypoVereinsbank</link></company>
).  This catalog underwent several incarnations, and currently is published as a three volume group.  Volume I, called Specialized Issues, includes notes issued by local authorities, which circulated in a limited area.  Volume II called General Issues covers notes issued on a national scope, dated 1368 through 1960.  Volume III covers Modern Issues dated 1960 to present.  Each of the volumes is updated regularly, with Volume III now updated every year, Volumes I and II every 3 or so years.  While Pick no longer edits the catalogs (since 1994 the honor has passed to George S. Cuhaj), the catalogs are still commonly referred to as 'Pick Catalogs' and dealers and collectors alike refer to banknotes by their 'Pick number.'
Current issues of the three volumes include:

<p>

For years, the mode of collecting banknotes was through a handful of mail order dealers who issued price lists and catalogs.  In the early 1990s, it became more common for rare notes to be sold at various coin and currency shows via auction.  The illustrated catalogs and "event nature" of the auction practice seemed to fuel a sharp rise in overall awareness of paper money in the numismatic community.  Entire advanced collections are often sold at one time, and to this day single auctions can generate well in excess of $1 million dollars in gross sales.  Today, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../495/130495.xml">
eBay</link> has surpassed auctions in terms of highest volume of sales of banknotes.  However, as of 2005, rare banknotes still sell for much less than comparable rare coins.  There is wide consensus in the paper money collecting arena that this disparity is diminishing as paper money prices continue to rise at a rapid rate.</p>
<p>

There are many different organisations and societies around the world for the hobby including the International Bank Note Society (IBNS).</p>
