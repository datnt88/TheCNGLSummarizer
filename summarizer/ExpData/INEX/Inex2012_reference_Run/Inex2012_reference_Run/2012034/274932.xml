, demonology has evolved from a simple acceptance of demons to a complex study that has grown from the original ideas taken from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../959/1560959.xml">

Demonic possession</link></it>
</indent>

According to Christian tradition, a demon is an evil spirit, and can be either a fallen angel or the spirit of a condemned human, and its intent is to lead mankind into sin.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

Tradition says that demons do the most damage when they are given "ground" for their workings, i.e. when they are accepted, consciously or unconsciously, knowingly or unknowingly, by a person. Acceptance is often construed as committing sin; demons gradually gain control of the eyes when the eyes look upon sinful things, gain control of the tongue when it is used for slander or blaspheme.  Another way demons can be accepted by their human host is to tell lies that the human believes or give suggestions, subtly disguised as the host's own thoughts.  This phenomenon is called possession.  Examples of are given in the Gospels.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

Alleged victims of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../574/246574.xml">
demonic possession</link> may hear voices, becomes obsessed or fixated on an object or idea, develop a split personality, be impervious to reason, develop a hatred of God, or become interested in bestiality or pedophilia.  These symptoms are usually signs of mental illness, not possession, and should be treated by a licensed medical professional.</p>
<p>

Forbidden rituals, including the 'Ritual E' Damo', the study of magic (both black magic and white magic, as both ultimately come from demons and are believed to lead to ruin), worshiping false gods, accepting visions received from evil spirits (mediums and diviners), and having faith that these visions will come to pass.</p>
<p>

Believers say that to protect against demonic possession, one must have faith in God,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> an alert watchfulness, a guarding of one's own mind, and a spoken refusal of the influence of all evil spirits. Prayer against the evil spirit or spirits, prayer to shed light on what action(s) was done or word(s) said that allowed them ground for possession so that this too can be refused are also often necessary.</p>

 are demons. Enoch explains; ‘And now, the giants, who are produced from the spirits (Angels) and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling. Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men and from the holy Watchers is their beginning and primal origin; they shall be evil spirits on earth, and evil spirits shall they be called. [As for the spirits of heaven, in heaven shall be their dwelling, but as for the spirits of the earth which were born upon the earth, on the earth shall be their dwelling.] And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth, and cause trouble: they take no food, but nevertheless hunger and thirst, and cause offences. And these spirits shall rise up against the children of men and against the women, because they have proceeded from them. From the days of the slaughter and destruction and death of the giants, from the souls of whose flesh the spirits, having gone forth, shall destroy without incurring judgement’. (Enoch15v8-12, 16v1. C.H.Charles.) </p>

Number of demons</st>

<p>

The number of demons, at least according to Christian demonology, is high. It can be deduced from the fact that the Bible mentions <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../701/387701.xml">
fallen angel</link>s</it>, and not only one. Much has added to the growth of the number of demons when Christian <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../503/30503.xml">
theology</link> said that all <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../340/23340.xml">
Pagan</link> deities were demons.</p>
<p>

In early times of Christianity it was accepted an unknown number of demons, but later, during the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../895/2287895.xml">
Late Middle Ages</link>, some demonologists tried to evaluate this number.</p>
<p>

Some scholars did not accept a unique number of demons. <saint wordnetid="110546850" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../020/38020.xml">
Gregory of Nyssa</link></saint>
, in the 4th century, supported the idea that demons procreated with other demons and with women, believing in the existence of male and female demons.</p>
<p>

Other scholars supported the idea that the number of demons was unique and they could not procreate.</p>
<p>

As it had been said by Christian theology that there were 400 million angels, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../043/5424043.xml">
Alfonso de Spina</link> calculated that about one third of them were demons, and in 1467 he asserted that the number of demons was 133,316,666 demons. This idea of one third of the angels turned into demons seems to be due to an exegesis of  the <work wordnetid="104599396" confidence="0.8">

Characteristics</st>

<p>

In Christian tradition, demons like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../136/19404136.xml">
angel</link>s, are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../387/28387.xml">
spiritual</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/3900306.xml">
immutable</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../052/177052.xml">
immortal</link>. Demons are not <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../781/22781.xml">
omniscient</link>, but each one has a specific knowledge (sometimes on only one subject, sometimes on more than one). Their power is limited to that which <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../765/5042765.xml">
God</link> allows, so they are not <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../776/22776.xml">
omnipotent</link>. No reference has been made about <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../271/218271.xml">
omnipresence</link>, so it is as yet unclear if they can be in different places at the same time, but according to the tradition of the medieval witches' <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../497/248497.xml">
Sabbath</link>, two conclusions can be reached: either <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/8539.xml">
the Devil</link> can be in different places at the same time, or he sends an emissary in his name.</p>
<p>

Christian demonology states that the mission of the demons is to induce humans to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../307/28307.xml">
sin</link>, often by testing their faith in God.  Christian tradition holds that temptations come from three sources: the world, the flesh, and the devil.  </p>
<p>

It is also believed that demons torment people during their life, like the case of <link>
Job</link> or through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../574/246574.xml">
possession</link>, causing disgraces or simply showing themselves before persons to frighten them, or by provoking visions that could induce people to sin or to be afraid. (<work wordnetid="104599396" confidence="0.8">

<p>

Referring to their appearance, demons can take any desired appearance, even that of an "angel of light" (<link>
2 Corinthians</link> 11:14). Nevertheless, they were generally described as ugly and monstrous beings by Christian demonologists. Many of these descriptions have inspired famous painters like <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

Moloch</link> and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/249354.xml">

<p>

About the colour of the demons' skin, since early times it was associated with black, thinking that they assumed the appearance of a black man, although not all descriptions agreed, giving demons very different aspects. Satan and other demons were also often depicted as black-dressed men, often riding a black horse. When demons appeared in the shape of animals, often they were black.</p>

Henri Boguet</link> and some English demonologists of the same epoch asserted that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../959/33959.xml">

Demons are believed to have the power to physically or mentally hurt people, but only within the boundaries of what God will allow. Demons can destroy anything material on the earth; these supernatural powers are always inferior to the power of God. God may use His will to cancel or destroy any effect the demon chooses to invoke.  Demons, assumably, are granted permission to test, bring about trials, and to tempt people through the use of their destructive powers, to make people prove their faith, sometimes as a means to carry out the will of the Lord. Often Demons are said to creating negative emotions, wreaking havoc, ensuing chaos, and disrupting peace.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>

Incarnation of demons</st>


<p>

The <b>incarnation of the demons</b> has been a problem to Christian demonology and theology since early times. A very early form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../215/78215.xml">
incarnation</link> of demons was the idea of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../574/246574.xml">
demon possession</link>, trying to explain that a demon entered the body of a person with some purpose or simply to punish that one for some allegedly committed sin. But this soon acquired greater proportions, trying to explain how demons could seduce people to have sexual relationships with them or induce them to commit other sins. To <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../522/18337522.xml">
Christian</link> <link>
scholar</link>s demons had to manifest themselves in a visible and if possible tangible form.</p>

 was, apparently, the first who wrote on this subject. He believed that demons, to materialise, had to condense vapours and with them form the body of a person or animal, then entering that body as if it were a puppet to which they gave life. <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 supported this idea, saying that their bodies were cold due to the solidification of water vapour to form them (see below). Many authors believed that demons could assume the shape of an animal, preferably black.</p>
<p>

It seems that until the first millennium, when the fear for the coming of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../399/19156399.xml">
Antichrist</link> reached proportions that were out of control, the appearance of demons was not a significant problem. But since this moment on, demons acquired a terrible appearance in the mind of those who believed to have seen them.</p>

 followed Augustine's idea, but added that demonic materialisation had sexual connotations because demons tried to seduce people to commit sexual sins.</p>
<p>

<link>
Ambrogio de Vignati</link>, disagreeing with other authors, asserted that demons, besides of not to have a material body could not create it, and all what they seemed to do was a mere hallucination provoked by them in the mind of those who had made a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../547/2145547.xml">

Sexuality of demons</st>

<p>

The demons' <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/13947297.xml">
buttocks</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../369/29369.xml">
genitalia</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../168/18842168.xml">
sperm</link> were a subject of dedicated study by Christian theologians, demonologists and inquisitors. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../191/15191.xml">
Inquisition</link> seemed to have been particularly interested in this topic.</p>
<p>

Concerning the demons' behind, and lever testicals, there were confessions asserting that they were normal, others telling that instead of an anus they had another mouth and thus when kissing their behind during the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../497/248497.xml">
Sabbath</link> people received another kiss in exchange, and confessions telling that demons did not have buttocks.</p>
<p>

About the demons' <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../193/67193.xml">
testicle</link>s, only one witch confessed to <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9638700866880419">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../885/267885.xml">
Pierre de Rostegny</link></person>
 that the demon with whom she had sexual relationships had them. Other confessions denied that demons had them. Henri Boguet supported the idea that demons did not have sexual organs and <link>
Johann Meyfarth</link> asserted that demons did not have a penis.</p>
<p>

The demons' <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../701/17322701.xml">
penis</link> was a problem for inquisitors and scholars. Many of them manifested a morbid interest in the demons' genitalia, but the penis reached pathological proportions. Many questions during the interrogatories in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../264/266264.xml">
witch trial</link>s referred to this theme. All persons confessed to have had sexual relationships with at least one demon, but the descriptions given of this particular part of their anatomy vary from a small phallus to a big one. Some confessions described a normal penis in the appropriate place, others a normal one in the behind, others two phalluses, one in its place and the other in the behind, and others a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../050/3553050.xml">
bifid</link> one, like the tongue of a snake. Confessions that described two phalluses or a bifid one often added the particularity that the demon practised vaginal and anal coitus at the same time; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../701/2629701.xml">
Sylvester Prieras</link> was a supporter of this idea. Even some confessions described three penises. In one legend, it was described to be six-foot long. Concerning the material of which it were made, there were confessions affirming that it was normal and flesh-made, others saying that it was iron or horn-made, others telling that it was half flesh and half iron, and others saying that it had scales and, being scaly, the sexual act was painful; even some confessions asserted that it was bone or wooden-made.</p>
<p>

The sperm of the demons constituted another problem. Some persons confessed that this sperm was icy, meanwhile others felt it as that of a common man. But another problem arose among scholars to determine if demons had their own sperm or not. <link>
Ludovico Maria Sinistrari</link> was one of the few authors that supported the idea that demons were corporeal entities that had their own sperm and with it could impregnate women and conceive children with them. But most scholars denied the idea that demons could have their own sperm, and concluded that they took sperm from men. The problem grew when these authors had to explain how demons took that sperm, how did they put it into a woman's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../701/17322701.xml">
vagina</link>, and if that sperm could conceive children or not.</p>
<p>

Most theologians agreed in the fact that demons acted first as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../796/27796.xml">
succubae</link> to collect sperm from men and then as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../244/439244.xml">
incubi</link> to put it into a woman's vagina.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> But as many of them agreed also in the fact that demons' bodies were icy, they reached the conclusion that the frozen sperm taken first from a man could not have generative qualities. <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../544/197544.xml">
pentagram</link>, which has been used with various meanings in many cultures (including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../522/18337522.xml">
Christian</link>ity, in which it denoted the five wounds of Christ), is sometimes considered a diabolical sign when inverted (one point downwards, two points up). Such a symbol may appear with or without a surrounding circle, and sometimes contains the head of a male goat, with the horns fitting into the upper points of the star, the ears into the side points, the beard into the lowest one, and the face into the central pentagon.</p>

Not all Christians accept that demons exist in a literal sense. There is the view that the New Testament language of exorcism is an example of the language of the day being employed to describe the healings of what today would be classified as epilepsy, mental illness etc.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>
