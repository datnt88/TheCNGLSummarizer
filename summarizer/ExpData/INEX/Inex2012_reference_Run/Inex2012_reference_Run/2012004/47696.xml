A <b>sport utility vehicle</b> (<b>SUV</b>) is a generic marketing description for a rugged automotive vehicle similar to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../037/168037.xml">
station wagon</link> but built on a light-truck chassis.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> Usually equipped with four-wheel drive for on or off road ability, some SUVs include the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../000/8554000.xml">
towing capacity</link> of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../877/47877.xml">
pickup truck</link> with the passenger-carrying space of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/20828.xml">
minivan</link>. SUVs are considered <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/467044.xml">
light truck</link>s and often share the same platforms of pickups and thus are regulated less stringently than passenger cars under two major laws in the U.S.—the Energy Policy and Conservation Act for fuel economy standards, and the Clean Air Act for emissions standards<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

It is known in some countries as an "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../081/718081.xml">
off-road vehicle</link>" or "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../649/444649.xml">
four-wheel drive</link>", often abbreviated to "4WD" or "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../649/444649.xml">
4x4</link>", pronounced "four-by-four". However, not all SUVs have four-wheel drive capabilities. Conversely, not all 4WD passenger vehicles are SUVs. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../081/718081.xml">
Off-road vehicles</link> are a very different class of vehicles, being vehicles primarily built for off-road use. Although some SUVs have off-road capabilities, this is often a secondary role and they often do not have the ability to switch between 2WD, 4WD high gearing and 4WD low gearing. While automakers frequently tout a particular SUV's off-road prowess with advertising and naming, the daily use of SUVs is largely paved roads and urban areas.</p>
<p>

Initially extremely popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the SUV's popularity has since declined, due to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../149/8669149.xml">
criticism regarding excessive gasoline consumption, pollution, cost, and poor safety</link>. Due to high oil prices and a declining economy since the mid-2000s, manufacturers have responded to buyers' complaints. The traditional truck-based SUV is gradually being supplanted by a new vehicle type, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../025/912025.xml">
crossover SUV</link>, which uses an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../345/13673345.xml">
car platform</link> for lighter weight and better <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../520/342520.xml">
fuel efficiency</link>, but is no longer designed or recommended by the manufacturer for off-road usage or towing.</p>

Design characteristics</st>

<p>

Although designs vary, the SUVs have historically been mid-sized passenger vehicles constructed using a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../124/1399124.xml">
body-on-frame</link> chassis similar to that found on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/467044.xml">
light truck</link>s. They usually have <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../194/166194.xml">
gasoline engine</link>s, often employing similar engines as pickup trucks, while a few SUVs are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../540/8540.xml">
diesel</link>s.</p>
<p>

Most SUVs are designed with a square <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../370/1337370.xml">
cross-section</link>, an engine compartment, a combined passenger and cargo compartment, and no dedicated trunk (i.e. a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../037/168037.xml">
station wagon</link> body). Most mid-size and full-size SUVs have three rows of seats with a cargo area directly behind the last row of seats. <grouping wordnetid="101012360" confidence="0.8">

A few of the most known design characteristics of SUVs are their high ground clearance, upright, boxy body, and high <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../655/16591655.xml">
H-point</link>. Lately, SUV bodies have become more aerodynamic to reduce wind resistance and improve <conveyance wordnetid="103100490" confidence="0.8">

<p>

The increase in SUV sales was assisted by a legislative loophole. Created in the 1970s, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards were established as minimums for passenger vehicles. Exceptions were granted business and farm vehicles. Car manufacturers utilized this loophole by selling SUVs as work vehicles.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> In the last 25 years, and even more in the last decade, the popularity of SUVs has increased among urban drivers. Consequently, more modern SUVs often come with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../696/47696.xml">
luxury</link> features and some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../025/912025.xml">

 (EPA) for a waiver to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../291/697291.xml">

Popularity</st>
<p>

SUVs became popular in the United States, Canada, and Australia in the 1990s and early 2000s for a variety of reasons, this trend was known as the <b>SUV craze</b>. </p>
<p>

US automakers could enjoy profit margins of $10,000 per SUV, while losing a few hundred dollars on a compact car. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> For instance, the <car wordnetid="102958343" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Vehicle buyers were drawn to their large cabins, higher <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../946/2148946.xml">
ride height</link>, and perceived <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../341/330341.xml">
safety</link>. Full-sized SUVs often offered features such as 3-row seating, so they effectively replaced full-size <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../037/168037.xml">
station wagon</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/20828.xml">
minivan</link>s; wagons were seen as old-fashioned, while minivans generally had poor road handling. Additionally, full-size SUVs have greater towing capabilities than conventional cars, and can haul <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/853756.xml">
trailers</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../630/358630.xml">
travel trailers (caravans)</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../996/3996.xml">
boat</link>s. Increased ground clearance is useful in climates with heavy snow. The very low oil prices of the 1990s helped to keep down running costs. The SUV's utilitarian image may partially explain its popularity, not least among some women, who constitute more than half of all SUV drivers. For women in the United States, an SUV is one of the most popular vehicle choices. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref></p>

In Australia, SUV sales were helped by the fact that SUVs attracted much lower <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/55551.xml">
import duty</link> than cars, so that they cost less than similarly-equipped imported sedan.  However this gap has been narrowed, as the import duty on cars has now been lowered to 10%, compared with 5% for SUVs.</p>

Due to high oil prices and a declining economy since the mid-2000s, sales of SUVs and other light trucks have fallen. In June 2008, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, which have limited paved roads and require the vehicle to have all-terrain handling, increased range, and storage capacity. The low availability of spare parts and the need to carry out repairs quickly allow model vehicles with the bare minimum of electric and hydraulic systems to predominate. Typical examples are the Land Rover and the <car wordnetid="102958343" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 the term 'SUV' is not widely used and carries a negative connotation of very large, American vehicles which are not sold in Australia.  Passenger class vehicles designed for offroad use are known as '<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../649/444649.xml">
four wheel drive</link>s', or '4WDs', or '4X4s'.  Some manufacturers do refer to their products as SUVs, but others invent names such as XUV <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref>, crossovers <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref> or even Action Utility Vehicles (AUVs) <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref>.  The crossover name is meant to indicate the vehicle is both 4WD and roadcar, but in reality, these crossovers are far more roadcar than offroader. The motoring press refers to vehicles of the crossover class as softroaders, but manufacturers do not use this term.  The term 'AWD', or All Wheel Drive is used for any vehicle that drives all four wheels but is not designed for any offroad use.  The most notable exponent of all wheel drive is Subaru <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref>, who have made it a mainstay of their advertising for many years.</p>

The Australian "utility" or "ute" (an abbreviation of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../739/7127739.xml">
"coupe utility"</link>, a vehicle type created in Australia in 1934) traditionally refers to a car-based commercial vehicle with an open load area at the rear. Utes can be 2WD or 4WD, and many are available in both formats, for example the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 . The term is also widely used in New Zealand.  These vehicles are known in South Africa as bakkies, and elsewhere as pickups.</p>
