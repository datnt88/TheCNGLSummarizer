<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Clothing for Animals</b>: Described by Jay as something he "hates," shows items, usually from a catalog, meant to be worn by a pet, usually a cat or a dog. Jay usually says that they are ridiculous because the animal would refuse to wear the item, and the owner would likely be attacked if he or she attempted to dress the pet. Jay usually says "Your dog(or cat) is not going to wear that!" </entry>

<b>Dumb criminals</b>: Often described by Jay as something he "loves," they tell stories of criminals who make "dumb" mistakes, i.e. criminals who showed ID when asked, held their hands in front of their faces to disguise themselves, and showing their picture on <series wordnetid="108457976" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../485/310485.xml">
America's Most Wanted</link></series>
 for ID. On several occasions, there have been stupid victims. A man reported his bicycle stolen. When the police got there, they found what appeared to be a bicycle chain combination near the bicycle rack. When asked, the victim claimed he left the combination there in case he forgot it. Another stupid victim, when told that the man who robbed him had been arrested for burglary, complained that he had not wanted the man arrested for burglary, but for breaking in and stealing his stuff. </entry>

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Police blotter</b>: Police radio transcripts and local police logs with strange items ('a woman calling in to report that she had a stupid husband' and 'chicken at large'), possible typos (donuts found loitering in a field), or misunderstanding the problem (man mistakes a gun for a birthday cake, boy calling Help which was the name for his cat). Jay usually reads this in a stern tone of voice, like that of a police officer. </entry>

<b>Dual meanings</b>: Headlines with phrasing that gives a different meaning than what the author intended, i.e. "Fat kids make huge impact" or "Condom found in bag of nuts." </entry>

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>What Do You Think?</b>: Newspapers often ask people about controversial issues. Non sequitur responses are sent in, i.e. a college student asked about the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../656/92656.xml">
gay marriage</link> debate replies that he hasn't thought about it because he just woke up, and a man with a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../327/38327.xml">
cigarette</link> hanging from his mouth disapproves of cell phone towers because they "give you cancer." One man responds to the question "whether the high price of gas would ruin their vacation" with "No, because I'm going to jail." Another woman was asked what she was doing to protect the environment. She replied, "Someone stole my car, so now I don't drive."</entry>
