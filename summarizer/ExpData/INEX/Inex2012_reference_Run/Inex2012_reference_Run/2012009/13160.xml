Gelatin is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../634/23634.xml">

cattle</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/13645.xml">
horse</link>s. The natural molecular bonds between individual collagen strands are broken down into a form that rearranges more easily. Gelatin melts when heated and solidifies when cooled again. Together with water, it forms a semi-solid <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../346/5346.xml">
colloid</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../207/41207.xml">
gel</link>. Gelatin forms a solution of high <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/18963754.xml">
viscosity</link> in water, which sets to a gel on cooling, and its chemical composition is, in many respects, closely similar to that of its parent collagen. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> Gelatin solutions show viscoelastic flow and streaming <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../412/174412.xml">
birefringence</link>. If gelatin is put into contact with cold water, some of the material dissolves. The solubility of the gelatin is determined by the method of manufacture. Typically, gelatin can be dispersed in a relatively concentrated acid. Such dispersions are stable for 10-15 days with little or no chemical changes and are suitable for coating purposes or for extrusion into a precipitating bath. Gelatin is also soluble in most polar solvents. Gelatin gels exist over only a small temperature range, the upper limit being the melting point of the gel, which depends on gelatin grade and concentration and the lower limit, the ice point at which ice crystallizes. The mechanical properties are very sensitive to temperature variations, previous thermal history of the gel, and time. The viscosity of the gelatin/water mixture increases with concentration and when kept cool (≈ 4 °C).</p>

</image>

The worldwide production amount of gelatin is about 300,000 tons per year (roughly 600 million lbs.) <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. On a commercial scale, gelatin is made from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../885/726885.xml">
by-product</link>s of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../940/18940.xml">
meat</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../062/18062.xml">
leather</link> industry, mainly pork skins, pork and cattle bones, or split cattle hides. Recently, by-products of the fishery industry began to be considered as raw material for gelatin production because they eliminate most of the religious obstacles surrounding gelatin consumption <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>. Contrary to popular belief, horns and hooves are not used.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> The raw materials are prepared by different curing, acid, and alkali processes which are employed to extract the dried collagen hydrolysate. These processes <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> may take up to several weeks, and differences in such processes have great effects on the properties of the final gelatin products <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>.</p>
<p>

Gelatin can also be prepared at home. Boiling certain cartilaginous cuts of meat or bones will result in gelatin being dissolved into the water. Depending on the concentration, the resulting broth, when cooled, will naturally form a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../162/13162.xml">
jelly</link> or gel. This process, for instance, may be used for the <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../650/2586650.xml">
pot-au-feu</link></it> dish.</p>
<p>

While there are many processes whereby collagen can be converted to gelatin, they all have several factors in common. The intermolecular and intramolecular bonds which stabilize insoluble collagen rendering it insoluble must be broken, and the hydrogen bonds which stabilize the collagen <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../924/179924.xml">
helix</link> must also be broken <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. The manufacturing processes of gelatin consists of three main stages:</p>

</list>
</p>

<ss1>
<st>
 Pretreatments </st>
<p>

If the physical material which will be used in production is bones, dilute acid solutions should be used to remove calcium and similar salts. Hot water or several solvents may be used for degreasing. Maximum fat content of the material should not exceed 1% before the main extraction step. If the raw material is hides and skin, size reduction, washing, removing hair from the hides, and degreasing are the most important pretreatments used to make the hides and skins ready for the main extraction step. Raw material preparation for extraction is done by three different methods: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../656/656.xml">
acid</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../ury/30th_century.xml">
alkali</link>, and enzymatic treatments. Acid treatment is especially suitable for less fully <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../106/1089106.xml">
crosslink</link>ed materials such as pig skin collagen. Pig skin collagen is less complex than the collagen found in bovine hides. Acid treatment is faster than alkali treatment and requires normally 10 to 48 hours. Alkali treatment is suitable for more complex collagen as being in bovine hides. This process requires longer time, normally several weeks. The purpose of the alkali treatment is to destroy certain chemical crosslinkages still present in collagen. The gelatin obtained from acid treated raw material has been called type-A gelatin, and the gelatin obtained from alkali treated raw material is referred to as type-B gelatin. Enzymatic treatments used for preparing raw material for the main extraction step are relatively new. Enzymatic treatments have some advantages in contrast to alkali treatment. Time required for enzymatic treatment is short, the yield is almost 100% in enzymatic treatment, the purity is also higher, and the physical properties of the final gelatin product are better.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Extraction </st>
<p>

After preparation of the raw material, i.e., reducing crosslinkages between collagen components and removing some of the impurities such as fat and salts, partially purified collagen is converted into gelatin by extraction with either water or acid solutions at appropriate temperatures. This extraction is one of the most important steps in gelatin production. All industrially used processes are based on neutral or acid pH values because alkali treatments speed up conversion, but, at the same time, degradation processes are promoted. Acid extract conditions are extensively used in the industry but the degree of acid varies with different processes. This extraction step is a multi stage process, and extraction temperature is usually increased in later extraction steps. This procedure ensures the minimum thermal degradation of the extracted gelatin.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Recovery </st>
<p>

This process includes several steps such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../665/11665.xml">
filtration</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../303/10303.xml">
evaporation</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../144/414144.xml">
sterilization</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../803/3128803.xml">
drying</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../069/274069.xml">
grinding</link>, and sifting. These operations are concentration-dependent and also dependent on the particular gelatin used. Degradation must be avoided or minimized. For this purpose, limiting the temperature as much as possible would be helpful. Rapid processing is required for most of them. All of these processing steps should be done in several stages to avoid extensive deterioration of peptide structure. Otherwise, low gelling strength would be obtained that is not generally desired.</p>

<p>

Probably best known as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../094/2909094.xml">

Gelatin is one of the few foods that cause a net loss of protein if eaten exclusively. In the 1970s, several people died of malnutrition while on popular liquid protein diets. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>
<p>

For decades, gelatin has been touted as a good source of protein. It has also been said to strengthen nails and hair. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.mysimon.com/Cosmetics/9000-10951_8-0.html?pagenum=9&amp;orderby=2">

http://www.waningmoon.com/nails/faq.shtml}</weblink> However, there is little scientific evidence to support such an assertion, one which may be traced back to Knox's revolutionary marketing techniques of the 1890s, when it was advertised that gelatin contains protein and that lack of protein causes dry, deformed nails. In fact, the human body itself produces abundant amounts of the proteins found in gelatin. Furthermore, dry nails are usually due to a lack of moisture, not protein.</p>

Several Russian researchers offer the following opinion regarding certain peptides found in gelatin:  "gelatin peptides reinforce resistance of the stomach mucous tunic to ethanol and stress action, decreasing the ulcer area by twice."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>

 Safety concerns </st>

Strict regulations apply for all steps in the gelatin manufacturing process. Gelatin is produced from natural raw materials which originate from animals that have been examined and accepted for human consumption by veterinary authorities. Hygienic regulations with respect to fresh raw materials are ensured and each batch of raw material delivered to the manufacturing plant is immediately checked and documented.</p>
<p>

In addition to the raw material quality, also the production process itself is an effective quality assurance measure. In the production process a comprehensive monitoring system ensures that potential risks are minimized. In USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with support from the TSE Advisory Committee, has since 1997 been monitoring the potential risk of transmitting animal diseases, especially bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This study has scientifically proven that the gelatin manufacturing process itself is an effective barrier towards the proliferation of possible BSE prions.</p>
<p>

The tests were based on a worst case scenario where the raw material came from BSE-infected cattle. No BSE prions could be detected in the gelatin produced by several manufacturing methods. Injections of these gelatins into the brain of experimental animals gave no establishment of TSE diseases. As a result of these experiments the FDA confirmed the safety of bovine bone gelatin. Prior to FDA, the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of the European Union (EU) in 2003 confirmed that the risk associated with bovine bone gelatin is close to zero. In 2006 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stated that the SSC opinion was confirmed, that the BSE risk of bone-derived gelatin was very small, and that there was no support for the request of excluding the skull and vertebrae of bovine origin older than 12 months from the material used in gelatin manufacturing.</p>
<p>

All reputable gelatin manufacturers today follow the Quality Management System according to ISO 9001 to comply with all required physical, chemical, microbiological and technical production and quality standards. In this way all process steps follow international laws and customer-specific quality parameters and are guaranteed and documented. For pharmaceutical grade gelatins strict regulations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European CPMP’s regulation and European Pharmacopoeia must be fulfilled. A detailed overview of the regulatory requirements for gelatin production can be found in the Gelatine Handbook, page 99-101 <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref>.</p>
