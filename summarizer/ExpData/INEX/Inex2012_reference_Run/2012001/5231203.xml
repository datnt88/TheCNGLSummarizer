Lennon lived with Smith and his wife for the majority of his childhood, and Smith taught the young Lennon to read, read him nursery rhymes at night, and later taught Lennon how to solve crossword puzzles. He also taught him to draw and paint and bought him his first <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../349/14349.xml">

Although George Toogood Smith's father's name is unknown, his mother was Alice Smith (d. 1949, aged 80) who had four children: Eleanor (1896–1965, aged 70) Robert (1899–1918, aged 20) George (1903–1955, aged 52) and Frank (unknown). (Her second child, Robert, was killed in action in France on 30 August 1918—shortly before the end of <conflict wordnetid="100958896" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Smith operated his family's two dairy farms and a shop with his brother Frank in the village of Woolton. The farms had been in the Smith family for four generations. Smith delivered milk by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../735/180735.xml">

When other girls were thinking of marriage, Mimi Stanley talked of challenges and adventures. She once confided that she never wanted to get married, as she hated the idea of being "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../487/54487.xml">
