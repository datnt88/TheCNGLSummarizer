The <b>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</b> (<b>NHTSA</b>, often pronounced "nit-suh") is an agency of the Executive Branch of the  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../149/195149.xml">
U.S. Government</link>, part of the <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/58235.xml">

.  It describes its mission as “Save lives, prevent injuries, reduce vehicle-related crashes.”<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>.</p>
<p>

As part of its activities, NHTSA is charged with writing and enforcing safety, theft-resistance, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/4313931.xml">
fuel economy</link> standards for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../095/145095.xml">
motor vehicle</link>s, the latter under the rubric of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../246/440246.xml">
Corporate Average Fuel Economy</link> (CAFE) system. NHTSA also licenses <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../778/163778.xml">
vehicle manufacturer</link>s and importers, allows or blocks the import of vehicles and safety-regulated vehicle parts, administers the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../136/166136.xml">

.</p>
<p>

Another of NHTSA’s major activities is the creation and maintenance of the data files maintained by the National Center for Statistics and Analysis. In particular, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../843/4009843.xml">
Fatality Analysis Reporting System</link>, or FARS, has become a resource for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../679/354679.xml">
traffic safety</link> research not only in the US, but throughout the world&#91;&#93;. Research contributions using FARS by researchers from many countries appear in many non-US technical publications, and provide a significant database and knowledge bank on the subject. Even with this database, conclusive analysis of crash causes often remains difficult and controversial, with experts debating the veracity and statistical validity of results.</p>

 History </st>
<p>

In 1940, the United States implemented automobile design <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../780/418780.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Automotive+Headlights%22])">
legislation</link>, concerning <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../100/998100.xml">
sealed beam</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../780/418780.xml">
headlamps</link>, which had recently been invented and were an important safety advance at that time. This regulation, virtually unchanged for the next 40 years, set a pattern of using auto safety design legislation to freeze innovation at a point in time.  </p>
<p>

In 1958, the UN established the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../790/3247790.xml">
World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations</link>, which began to promulgate what would eventually become UN's Economic Commission for Europe or <b>ECE Regulations</b> on vehicle design, construction, and safety performance. The United States declined to join the forum or adopt its (or any other) vehicle safety regulations at that time. However, vehicles meeting the ECE safety standards were legal to import into the United States.</p>
<p>

In 1965 and 1966, public pressure grew in the US to increase <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../341/330341.xml">
the safety of cars</link>, culminating with the publishing of <it><work wordnetid="104599396" confidence="0.8">

<p>

In 1966, Congress held a series of highly publicized hearings regarding highway safety, and passed legislation to make installation of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../474/51474.xml">
seat belts</link> mandatory, and created several predecessor agencies which would eventually become the NHTSA, including the National Traffic Safety Agency, the National Highway Safety Agency, and the National Highway Safety Bureau.  One result was vehicles meeting the ECE safety standards were no longer automatically legal to import into the United States.</p>
<p>

The NHTSA was officially established in 1970 by the Highway Safety Act of 1970.  In 1972, the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act expanded NHTSA's scope to include consumer information programs.</p>
<p>

Since this era, automobiles have become far better in protecting their occupants in vehicle impacts. The number of deaths on American highways hover around 40,000 annually, a lower death rate per mile travelled than in the 1960s. </p>
<p>

NHTSA has conducted numerous high-profile investigations of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../352/337352.xml">
automotive</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../712/252712.xml">

<p>

In the US, NHTSA has introduced a proposal to mandate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../943/420943.xml">
Electronic Stability Control</link> on all passenger vehicles by the 2012 model year. This technology was first brought to public attention in 1997, with the Swedish <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../322/1030322.xml">

<p>

Consumers today have a far greater amount of auto safety information available, due to the efforts of NHTSA and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../285/1587285.xml">

<p>

In the mid 1960s when the framework was established for US vehicle safety regulations, the US auto market was an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../204/22204.xml">
oligopoly</link>, with just three companies (<company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../102/12102.xml">

Ford</link></company>
, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../882/6882.xml">
Chrysler</link>) controlling 85% of the market. At that time, the USA had safer traffic than any country in the world, whether measured by the number of traffic deaths per thousand vehicles, or the number of traffic deaths per 100 million miles.</p>

FMVSS</link> appended after a period, as for example 49CFR571.301 — the location of FMVSS 301. Additional Federal vehicle standards are contained elsewhere in the CFR. For instance, 49CFR564 contains the specifications and requirements for the various types of replaceable <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../780/418780.xml">
headlamp</link> "light source" (bulb).  FMVSS 209 was the first standard to become effective on March 1, 1967.</p>
<p>

Although a system of uniform <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../790/3247790.xml">
auto safety performance and equipment regulations</link> had been in place in Europe since 1958, the US did not seek to adopt or harmonize with these ECE regulations, which have since been adopted by virtually all industrialized countries outside North America. Compared to the ECE regulations, US regulations are fundamentally different in philosophy, content, emphasis, and enforcement protocol. Vehicles conforming to the internationalized (originally European) ECE regulations are allowed or required throughout the entire rest of the world, but such vehicles are illegal in the US because they don't conform to the US regulations. </p>
<p>

Despite the evolution of the North American auto market to include most of the world's major automakers, and the ongoing proliferation of US safety regulations, the previously-existing market oligopoly still exerts strong influence: US vehicle equipment and construction regulations are based almost entirely on <social_group wordnetid="107950920" confidence="0.8">

 standards, which were written almost entirely by US automakers. </p>
<p>

Some question whether the results of this regulatory philosophy and practice support a safety-related basis for the prohibition on ECE vehicles. The sizable auto safety lead enjoyed by the USA since the 1960s had slowed by 2002, with the US improvement percentages at 16th place (behind <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

) in terms of deaths per thousand vehicles.  In terms of deaths per 100 million miles, the USA had dropped from first place to tenth place. With the partial exception of Canada, all of the countries achieving better safety results either require or permit vehicles built to comply with the ECE regulations, not the US regulations.</p>
<p>

In a 2004 book, by former General Motors safety researcher Leonard Evans, government-data (FARS for US) showed other countries achieving safety performance improvements over time greater than those achieved by the US:</p>

Research on the trends in use of heavy vehicles indicate that a significant difference between the U.S. and other countries is the relatively high prevalence of pickup trucks and SUVs in the U.S. A 2003 study by the U.S. <institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">

</institution>
 found that SUVs and pickup trucks are significantly less safe than passenger cars, that imported-brand vehicles tend to be safer than American-brand vehicles, and that the size and weight of a vehicle has a significantly smaller effect on safety than the quality of the vehicle's engineering<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. Comparisons of past data with the present in the U.S can result in distortions, since the level of large commercial truck traffic has substantially increased from the 1960s while highway capacity has not kept pace with the increase in large commercial truck traffic on U.S highways.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> However, other factors exert significant influence; Canada has lower roadway death and injury rates despite a vehicle mix comparable to that of the US.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Nevertheless, the widespread use of truck-based vehicles as passenger carriers is correlated with roadway deaths and injuries not only directly by dint of vehicular safety performance <it>per se</it>, but also indirectly through the relatively low fuel costs that facilitate the use of such vehicles in North America.

Most of the reduction in vehicle fatality rates during the last third of the 20th Century were gained from the initial NHTSA safety standards during 1968-1984 and subsequent voluntary changes in vehicle crashworthiness by vehicle manufacturers

<p>

NHTSA's regulatory priorities and protocols have had an effect on the economic and selection aspects of the US vehicle market, as illustrated by the manner in which the <b>grey market</b> was dealt with.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
The Gray Market</st>
<p>

The United States blocks the importation of vehicles built to international <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../790/3247790.xml">
ECE Regulations</link> rather than the U.S. safety regulations. Because of the unavailability in America of certain vehicle models, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../013/655013.xml">
grey market</link> arose in the late 1970s. This provided an alternate, legal method to acquire vehicles only sold overseas. The success of the grey market, however, ate into the business of <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/18564164.xml">
Mercedes-Benz</link></company>
 of North America Inc, which launched a successful <legislature wordnetid="108163273" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/31756.xml">
congressional</link></legislature>
 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/48934.xml">
lobbying</link> effort to eliminate this alternative for consumers in 1988, despite the lack of any evidence suggesting grey-market vehicles were less safe than those built to comply with US regulations. As a result, it is no longer possible to import a non-US vehicle into the United States as a personal import, with few exceptions—primarily Canadian cars with safety regulations substantially similar to the United States, and vehicles imported temporarily for display or research purposes.</p>
<p>

In 1998, NHTSA exempted vehicles older than 25 years from the rules it administers, since these are presumed to be collector vehicles. However, the ban on newer vehicles considered safe in countries with lower vehicle-related death rates has led some to claim that the main effect of NHTSA's regulatory activity is to protect the US market for a modified oligopoly consisting of the three US-based automakers and the US operations of foreign-brand producers. It has been suggested<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> that the impetus for NHTSA's seeming preoccupation with market control rather than vehicular safety performance is a result of overt market protections such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/55551.xml">
tariffs</link> and local-content laws having become politically unpopular due to the increasing popularity of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/59212.xml">
free trade</link>. This has driven US industry to adopt less visible forms of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../591/660591.xml">
trade restrictions</link> in the form of technical regulations different but demonstrably not superior to those outside the US.</p>
<p>

An example of the market-control effects of NHTSA's regulatory protocol is found in the agency's 1974 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../407/1997407.xml">
banning</link> of the <link>
Citroën SM</link> automobile, which contemporary <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../100/50100.xml">
journalists</link> noted was one of the safest vehicles available at the time. NHTSA disapproved the SM due to its high-performance, low-glare, steerable <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../780/418780.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Dynamic+Headlight+Beam+Control%22])">

Unintended consequences</st>
<p>

Some NHTSA standards led to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../517/97517.xml">
unintended consequences</link>, especially in the early days of NHTSA. The majority Americans in the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s did not wear <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../474/51474.xml">
seat belts</link>, which are estimated to reduce the risk of death in a crash by about 45%. NHTSA attempted to promote belt use by a buzzer-light system that operated continuously if belts were not extended from their stowed positions. When that did not significantly increase use, NHTSA's response was an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../271/3271.xml">
authoritarian</link> one: seat belt/ignition interlock devices allowed as an alternative to airbags in all new 1974 vehicles, which prevented the car starting unless all front-seat occupants were belted. The interlock provoked such an uproar that Congress forced NHTSA to repeal the standard. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/60023.xml">
Airbags</link> were beginning to be discussed as <it>replacements</it> for seat belts — not as supplementary restraints — and  while <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 sold a small number of vehicles with dual front airbags and no front seat belts between 1974 and 1977, the controversial mandate for airbags in all US-sold vehicles did not take force until the early 1990s. </p>

There are nominally strict cost-benefit ratio requirements for every safety device or system NHTSA mandates for installation on vehicles. That is, the device or system must save more money than it costs, or must cost no more than a specified amount of money per life saved, or it may not legally be mandated. Such requirements are subject to manipulation of estimated costs and estimated benefits to justify or reject almost any standard: FMVSS #208 effectively mandates the installation of frontal <occupation wordnetid="100582388" confidence="0.8">

ECE Regulations</link> followed outside North America.</p>
<p>

The world's first halogen headlamp bulbs, high-performance designs known as H1 and H3, were introduced in Europe in 1962 and 1964, respectively, and quickly became standard the world over, but they were not permitted in the US until 1997. Likewise, the first two-filament high/low beam halogen headlamp bulb, another high-performance design called H4, was introduced in Europe in 1971 and immediately became the world standard, but was not legalized in the US until 1992. Other lighting-related lags attributed to cost-effectiveness regulations selectively obeyed by NHTSA are evident in US regulations; for example, virtually every country in the world has since at least the early 1970s required rear <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../054/876054.xml">

NHTSA also administers the controversial <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../246/440246.xml">
Corporate Average Fuel Economy</link> (<b>CAFE</b>), which is intended to incentivize the production of fuel-efficient vehicles by dint of fuel economy requirements measured against the sales-weighted average of each manufacturer's range of vehicles. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/173070.xml">
Wall Street Journal</link> and others argue this program forces people to buy smaller, lighter, less-safe vehicles. CAFE may be a driving factor behind the explosion in demand for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../696/47696.xml">
SUV</link>s, which are considered "light trucks" for CAFE purposes and therefore are not required to meet the stricter standards for vehicles classified as "cars." Many governments outside North America regulate fuel economy by heavily taxing motor fuel and/or by including a vehicle's engine size or fuel economy in calculating vehicle registration taxes. It is argued that such regulations are not politically feasible, and that doing so would hurt the struggling US auto industry<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref>

Another putative problem with CAFE is that fuel economy is negatively correlated to vehicle weight — lighter vehicles giving better fuel economy — while vehicle weight is positively correlated to safety — larger and heavier vehicles better protect their occupants.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> Thus, NHTSA must accomplish two potentially contradictory regulatory goals at the same time.

Aerodynamics brings change to NHTSA</st>

Automakers faced an inherent conflict between NHTSA's stringent headlight legislation, which froze U.S. headlight technology in 1940, and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../246/440246.xml">
Corporate Average Fuel Economy</link> standard, which effectively mandated that automakers develop ways to improve the ability of the car to cleave the air. As a result, in the early 1980s, automakers lobbied for a modification of the mandate for fixed shape sealed-beam <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../780/418780.xml">

In 1979, NHTSA created the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) in response to Title II of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972, to improve occupant safety by developing and implementing meaningful and timely comparative safety information that encourages manufacturers to <b>voluntarily</b> improve the safety of their vehicles. Since that time, the agency has improved the program by adding rating programs, providing information to
consumers in a more user friendly format, and substantially increasing accessibility to the information via the website, http://www.safercar.gov. The program has strongly influenced manufacturers to build vehicles that consistently achieve high ratings, thereby increasing the safety of vehicles.</p>
<p>

The agency established a frontal impact test program whose protocol is based on Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208 “Occupant Crash Protection” except that the frontal 4 NCAP test is conducted at 56 km/h (35 mi/h), rather than 48 km/h (30 mi/h) as required by FMVSS No. 208.</p>
<p>

More recently, in an effort to improve the dissemination of NCAP ratings and as a result of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA–LU) the agency has issued a Final Rule requiring manufacturers to place NCAP star ratings on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../056/1663056.xml">
