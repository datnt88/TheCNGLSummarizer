<b>Criticism of sport utility vehicles</b> is the expression (made by various groups, organizations or individuals) of disapproval of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../696/47696.xml">
sport utility vehicle</link>s (SUVs). Criticism may focus on risks posed to other road users or to the environment by the larger SUVs, and often asserts that benefits to the vehicle owner are illusory or exaggerated.

One source of SUVs' popularity is the perception of significant <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../341/330341.xml">
safety</link> advantages over smaller vehicles,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. To this, critics claim that SUVs are more likely to roll over<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>, more likely to be in a single-car accident and more likely to cause harm to other road users.

Rollover</st>
<p>

The high center of gravity of SUVs makes them more prone to rollover <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../673/77673.xml">
accidents</link> than lower vehicles, especially if the vehicle leaves the road or in emergency maneuvers. Figures from the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.safercar.gov">
US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</weblink>  show that most passenger cars have about a 10% chance of rollover while most SUVs have between 14% to 20% (varying from a low of 14% for the AWD Ford Edge to a high of 23% for the FWD Ford Escape). Many modern SUVs are equipped with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../943/420943.xml">
electronic stability control</link> (ESC) to prevent rollovers on flat surfaces, but 95% of rollovers are "tripped" - meaning the vehicle strikes something low, such as a curb or shallow ditch, causing it to tip over<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>. ESC may however prevent the vehicle reaching the trip point.</p>

 pioneered the use of the blocker bar, a kind of under-vehicle roll bar designed to keep the vehicle from rolling over anything unfortunate enough to be hit by it. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>

Construction</st>
<p>

Older SUVs are typically built with a truck-style chassis with separate body, whereas many newer models are similar to cars, which are typically built with a monocoque <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../992/57992.xml">
unitary construction</link> (where the body actually forms the structure of the car). Separate chassis style designs are typically much less safe for the occupants than unitary construction.</p>

Due to a technical fault, readings from the on-board instrumentation was unavailable, so the program had to speculate, based on the appearance of the vehicles after the impact, that the structural design of the Discovery offered less driver/passenger protection than that in the 2003 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/20828.xml">

Risk to other drivers</st>
<p>

Because of SUVs' greater height and weight and rigid frames, it is contended by a columnist writing in <magazine wordnetid="106595351" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../365/31365.xml">
The New Yorker</link></magazine>
 magazine<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> that SUVs can affect traffic safety. This height and weight, while perhaps giving an advantage to occupants inside the vehicle, often poses a risk to drivers of smaller vehicles in multi-vehicle accidents, particularly side impacts<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>.  In 2003 and 2004 in the US, passenger cars were involved in 1.65 and 1.58 fatal crashes per 100M miles respectively compared to 2.14 and 2.05, nearly 30% more, for light trucks (SUVs pick-ups and vans)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>.  In 2004, light trucks were involved in fatal, 2 vehicle crashes with passenger cars (4,765 total, 0.435 per 100M miles) at nearly 3 times the rate as passenger cars (2,422 total, 0.149 per 100M miles)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>.  In the same year, light trucks were involved in fatal, 2 vehicle crashes with motorcycles (869 total, 0.079 per 100M miles) at a nearly 75% greater rate than passenger cars (738 total, 0.045 per 100M miles).  The same year, light trucks were involved in fatal, 2 vehicle crashes with large trucks at a 3.9% greater rate than passenger cars.  Fatal crashes between 2 light trucks occurred at nearly the same (but greater) rate as fatal crashed between 2 passenger cars.</p>
<p>

In parts of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../239/9239.xml">
Europe</link>, effective 2006, the fitting of metal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../764/2924764.xml">
bull bar</link>s, also known as grille guards, brush guards and push bars to vehicles such as 4x4s and SUVs is illegal (pedestrian safe rated plastic bars and grilles may be used). Bullbars are often used in Australia and parts of the United States to protect the vehicle from being disabled should it collide with wildlife.</p>

<st>
Visibility and backover deaths</st>
<p>

Because of their unconventional body proportions, SUVs can create visibility problems for other drivers by obscuring their view of traffic lights, signs, and other vehicles on the road, plus the road itself. SUV drivers also suffer from poor visibility to the side and especially to the rear; similarly, driving a low-built vehicle alongside an SUV blocks the driver of the low vehicle's view in the direction of the SUV. This has led to many "backover deaths" where SUVs run over small children when backing out of driveways. The problem of backover deaths became so widespread that rear facing backup cameras were installed on some SUVs so that the driver could see behind the vehicle.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>.  Australia's <organization wordnetid="108008335" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../707/662707.xml">
NRMA</link></organization>
 motoring organisation has tested a number of vehicles <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> and the results show that poor rearward visibility is by no means confined to any one type of vehicle.</p>
<p>

Steel bumpers are also used by Off Roaders and Overlanders to protect the vehicle while not on pavement. This is a compromise for highway driving though as these bumpers are heavy.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Wide bodies in narrow lanes</st>
<p>

The wider bodies of larger SUVs means they occupy a greater percentage of road lanes, leaving less room for error. This is particularly noticeable on the narrow roads sometimes found in dense urban areas.  SUVs also have difficulty fitting in some parking spaces and encroach further into traffic lanes when parked along side the road.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Recent improvements</st>
<p>

Manufacturers have added car-level bumpers to reduce the possibility of the other vehicle(s) sliding under the SUV in a collision.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Psychology</st>
<p>

SUV safety concerns are compounded by a perception among some consumers that SUVs are safer for their drivers than standard cars. According to <link>
G. C. Rapaille</link>, a psychological consultant to automakers (as cited in Gladwell, 2004), many consumers feel safer in SUVs simply because their ride height makes "[their passengers] higher and dominate and look down <it>(<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../780/2412780.xml">
sic</link>)</it>. That you can look down [on other people] is psychologically a very powerful notion." This and the height and weight of SUVs may lead to consumers' false perception of safety (Gladwell, 2004).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>. It is true that the additional visibility afforded by an elevated driving position can, if the driver uses it, have a beneficial effect on safety.</p>

, it was found that SUV drivers were 55% more likely to drive with only one hand on the top of the steering wheel than drivers of standard vehicles. This was considered indicative of a false sense of security compared to the drivers of smaller cars.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref>  </p>
<p>

Gladwell also noted that the SUV popularity is also a sign that people began to shift <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../341/330341.xml">
automobile safety</link> focus from active to passive, to the point that potential SUV buyers will give up extra 30&nbsp;ft (9.1&nbsp;m) of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../105/8811105.xml">
braking distance</link> because they believe they are helpless to avoid a tractor-trailer hit on any vehicle. Such notion of safety was confined to North America. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../649/444649.xml">
four-wheel drive</link> option available to SUVs reinforced the passive safety notion. In the case of 4WD, it does not improve braking. To support Gladwell's argument, he mentioned that automotive engineer David Champion noted that in his previous driving experience with <car wordnetid="102958343" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../068/884068.xml">
Range Rover</link></car>
, his vehicle slid across a four-lane road because he did not perceive the slipping that others had experienced.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Gladwell concluded that when a driver feels unsafe when driving a vehicle, it makes the vehicle safer. When a driver feels safe when driving, the vehicle becomes less safe.
Gladwell's findings were published in <it><magazine wordnetid="106595351" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../365/31365.xml">

</it> which is not a scientifically accredited publication (Gladwell, 2004).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

Stephen Popiel, a vice-president of Millward Brown Goldfarb automotive market-research company, noted that for most automotive consumers safety has to do with the notion that they are not in complete control.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Gladwell argued that many of the 'accidents' are not outside driver's control, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../428/511428.xml">
drunk driving</link>, wearing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../474/51474.xml">
seat belt</link>s, driver's age and experience, so a vehicle's safety also depends on the driver itself. Gladwell also noted <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../571/471571.xml">
learned helplessness</link> plays a role in choosing an SUV.</p>

False sense of security</st>
<p>

Despite some evidence to the contrary, many SUV owners believe that they themselves and their passengers are much safer in an SUV than in a car.  However, some studies indicate that SUV occupants are not dramatically safer and may even be less safe than car occupants.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref>  In 2004, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../530/989530.xml">
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</link> released results of a study that indicated that drivers of SUVs were 11% more likely to die in an accident than people in cars.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref>  These figures may be compounded by variables other than the vehicles' inherent safety, for example the documented tendency for SUVs to be driven more recklessly (most sensationally perhaps, the 1996 finding that SUV drivers are more likely to drive drunk).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> SUV drivers are also less likely to wear their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../474/51474.xml">

The NHTSA recorded occupant (driver or passenger) fatalities per 100M vehicle miles traveled at 1.16 in 2004 and 1.20 in 2003 for light trucks (SUVs, pick-ups and minivans) compared to 1.18 in 2004 and 1.21 in 2003 for passenger cars.

Under criticism are the marketing techniques used to sell SUVs. Advertisers and manufacturers alike have been assailed for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../232/325232.xml">
greenwashing</link>. Critics have cited SUV commercials that show the product being driven through a wilderness area, even as most SUVs are never driven off-road.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> Even the model names have been criticized for connoting exotic wilderness areas (Chevrolet Tahoe, Dodge Durango, GMC Denali) and ruggedness (Ford Explorer, Chevrolet Blazer, Ford Expedition, Jeep Commander) that have little to do with the typical daily use of an SUV (i.e., transportation on paved roads); only the <car wordnetid="102958343" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Tax benefits</st>
<p>

In the United States, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../275/2011275.xml">
Section 179 depreciation deduction</link>, sometimes known as the 'SUV subsidy' allows small-business owners to deduct up to $25,000 of the cost of a vehicle with a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../602/2193602.xml">
gross vehicle weight rating</link> of over 6000 lb (2722 kg) from their income for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/50845.xml">
income tax</link> calculation. Small-business owners may deduct $10,610 of the cost of a passenger automobile. This provides a slight tax incentive for businesses to purchase an SUV. However, the cost of both SUVs and automobiles is fully deductible over future years using normal depreciation. In previous years, this deduction reached $120,000 and was the subject of much criticism. When the vehicle is eventually sold, however, the depreciation taken must be recaptured as income, subject to taxation.</p>

Fuel economy</st>
<p>

The recent popularity of SUVs is generally thought of as one reason the U.S. population has begun to consume more gasoline than in previous years. SUVs are, as a class, much less fuel efficient than comparable passenger vehicles. The main reason is that SUVs are classified by the U.S. government as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/467044.xml">
light truck</link>s, and thus are subject to the less strict light truck standard under the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../246/440246.xml">
Corporate Average Fuel Economy</link> (CAFE) regulations. The CAFE requirement for light trucks is an average of 20.7 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../983/2130983.xml">
mpg</link> (US), versus 27.5 mpg (US) for passenger cars (11.4L/100km and 8.6L/100km, respectively).</p>
<p>

By design SUVs have numerous <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../520/342520.xml">
fuel-inefficient</link> features. Their high profile increases <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../292/2137292.xml">
wind resistance</link> and their mass requires heavier <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../618/354618.xml">
suspensions</link> and larger <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../640/9640.xml">
engines</link>, which both contribute to increased vehicle weight. Many SUVs come with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../037/65037.xml">
tire</link>s designed for off-road traction rather than low <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../750/1503750.xml">
rolling resistance</link>.</p>
<p>

The low fuel economy is caused by following relative to a passenger car:

Drag resistance for SUVs is at least (same drag coefficient) 30% higher and the acceleration force has to be 35% larger than family sedans if we use the figures from the above table. This gives a 40% higher fuel consumption (even for parallel hybrid electric SUVs) using the given formula for the power demand. </p>
<p>

Addressing fuel efficiency, several manufacturers now offer hybrid gas/electric models of SUVs, offering improved fuel economy over conventionally powered SUVs. With some hybrid SUV models, the added power generated from the hybrid systems is used some times to give vehicles added performance (increased power).  However, SUVs with hybrid engines still only experience gas mileage similar to that of gas powered family sedans, usually a smaller increase in fuel economy than sedans get when fitted with a hybrid engine.</p>

Pollution</st>
<p>

Because SUVs typically use more fuel than cars, they generate higher volumes of pollutants (particularly carbon dioxide) into the atmosphere during their working lives. In the U.S., light trucks and SUVs are held to a less-strict pollution control standard than are passenger cars. In response to the trend that a growing share of fuel consumption and emissions are attributable to these vehicles, the Environmental Protection Agency ruled that by model year 2009, emissions from all light trucks and passenger cars will be regulated equally.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref></p>

The length and width of large SUVs have caused problems in urban areas. In areas with limited parking spaces, large SUVs have been highly criticized for parking in stalls marked for compact cars or that are too narrow for the width of certain larger SUVs. Critics have stated that this causes problems such as the loss of use of the adjacent space, reduced accessibility into the entry of an adjacent vehicle, blockage of driveway space, and damage inflicted by the door of the SUV to adjacent vehicles.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> As a backlash against the alleged space consumption of SUVs, cities across the world, such as <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Declining Profits for Detroit Big Three Automakers</st>

Detroit's Big Three automakers</link> since the mid-late 2000s. </p>
