 The Newton in development </st>
<p>

The Newton project was not originally intended to produce a PDA. The PDA category did not exist for most of Newton's genesis, and the "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../304/23304.xml">
personal digital assistant</link>" term itself was coined relatively late in the development cycle by Apple's then-CEO <celebrity wordnetid="109903153" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../270/183270.xml">
John Sculley</link></celebrity>
<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>, the driving force behind the project. Newton was intended to be a complete reinvention of personal computing.  For most of its design lifecycle Newton had a large-format screen, more internal memory, and an object-oriented graphics kernel. One of the original motivating <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../006/300006.xml">
use case</link>s for the design was known as the "Architect Scenario", in which Newton's designers imagined a residential <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../170/1170.xml">
architect</link> working quickly with a client to sketch, clean up, and interactively modify a simple two-dimensional home plan.</p>
<p>

For a portion of the Newton's development cycle (roughly the middle third), the project's intended programming language was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../741/8741.xml">
Dylan</link> though in fact the language and environment never matured enough for any applications to be successfully written. Dylan was a small, efficient <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../757/22757.xml">
object-oriented</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../016/18016.xml">
Lisp</link> variant that still retains some interest. Although it was efficient (for its day, and considering its substantial run-time <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../079/234079.xml">
dynamism</link>), Dylan never lived up to its developers' performance expectations and was a tough sell for a development team unaccustomed to Lisp programming. When the move was made to a smaller form factor (designed by <celebrity wordnetid="109903153" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Its replacement, NewtonScript which had garbage collection, tight integration with the "soup" storage and user-interface toolkit, and was specifically designed to run in small RAM/large ROM environments.</p>
<p>

The project missed its original goals to reinvent personal computing, and then to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../181/13653181.xml">
rewrite</link> contemporary application programming. The Newton project fell victim to project slippage, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../415/398415.xml">
scope creep</link>, and a growing fear that it would interfere with Macintosh sales. It was reinvented as a PDA which would be a complementary Macintosh peripheral instead of a stand-alone computer which might compete with the Macintosh.</p>

 Application software </st>

<p>

The Newton was pre-loaded with a variety of software to aid in personal data organization and management.  This included such applications as Notes, Names, and Dates, as well as a variety of productivity tools such as a calculator, conversion calculators (metric conversions, currency conversions, etc), time-zone maps, etc.  In later versions of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../290/1052290.xml">
Newton OS</link> these applications were refined, and new ones were added, such as the Works word processor and the Newton Internet Enabler, as well as the inclusion of bundled <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/1177478.xml">
3rd party</link> applications, such as the QuickFigure Works spreadsheet (a "lite" version of Pelicanware's QuickFigure Pro), Pocket <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../967/1751967.xml">

, the NetHopper web browser, and the EnRoute email client.  Various Newton applications had full import/export capabilities with popular desktop office suite and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../329/283329.xml">
PIM (Personal Information Manager)</link> application file formats, primarily by making use of Apple's bundled <link>

 In version 2 of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../290/1052290.xml">
Newton OS</link>, the Notes application (as well as Names) could accept what Apple termed "stationary", 3rd-party created plug-in modules that could extend the functionality of the basic applications.</p>

, planning steps and sub-tasks, etc.  Each bullet point could contain as many lines of text as desired.  A bullet point could be dragged and placed underneath another bullet point, thus forming a hierarchical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../531/976531.xml">
outline</link>/<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../821/41821.xml">
tree</link>.  When a bullet point was dragged, the entire sub-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../821/41821.xml">
tree</link> of child bullet points underneath it (if any) would be dragged along as well.  If a bullet point had child bullet points, tapping the hollow parent bullet point once would "roll up" or collapse all the children (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../031/2187031.xml">
"windowshade" effect</link>).  The parent bullet point would become a solid black circle and all the children would disappear.  Tapping the parent bullet point again would make the children re-appear.</p>

Names</st>
<p>

The Names application was used for storing contacts.  Contacts created either on the Newton or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../329/283329.xml">
PIM</link> could be synchronized to each other. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>  Entering a date in Names for fields such as birthday or anniversary automatically created corresponding repeating events in the Dates application.  Each contact had an attached free-form notes field available to it, that could contain any mix of interleaved text, ink text, Shapes, or Sketches.  Like Notes, Names could be extended by developers, to create special new categories of contacts with specialized pre-defined fields.  Names shipped with 3 types of contacts, "people", "companies", and "groups", but a developer could define new types, for instance "client", "patient", etc.</p>

As with Names, Dates items created either on the Newton or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../329/283329.xml">
PIM</link> could be synchronized to each other.</p>

 Screen and input </st>
<p>

With the 1xx series, an optional keyboard became available, which can also be used via the dongle on a 2x00.</p>
<p>

The MessagePad 2x00 can be used with the screen turned horizontally ("landscape") as well as vertically ("portrait"). A change of a setting instantly rotates the contents of the display by 90, 180 or 270 degrees. Handwriting recognition still works properly with the display rotated.</p>

<ss2>
<st>
 Handwriting recognition </st>
<p>

In initial versions (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../290/1052290.xml">
Newton OS</link> 1.x) the Newton's handwriting recognition gave extremely mixed results for users and was often inaccurate.  The original handwriting recognition engine was called Calligrapher, and was licensed from a Russian company called Paragraph International.  Calligrapher's design was quite sophisticated; it attempted to learn the user's natural handwriting, using a database of known words to make guesses as to what the user was writing, and could interpret writing anywhere on the screen, whether hand-printed, in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/514932.xml">
cursive</link>, or a mix of the two. By contrast, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../544/37544.xml">
Palm Pilot's</link> Graffiti had a less sophisticated design than Calligrapher, but was more accurate and precise due to its reliance on a fixed, predefined stroke alphabet. The stroke alphabet used letter shapes which resembled standard handwriting, but which were modified to be both simple and very easy to differentiate. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

For editing text, Newton had an intuitive system for handwritten editing, such as scratching out words to be deleted, circling text to be selected, or using written <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../746/981746.xml">
caret</link>s to mark inserts. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

Later releases of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../290/1052290.xml">
Newton operating system</link> retained the original recognizer for compatibility, but added a hand-printed-text-only (not <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/514932.xml">
cursive</link>) recognizer, code-named "<link>
Rosetta</link>", which was developed by Apple, included in version 2.0 of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../290/1052290.xml">
Newton operating system</link>, and refined in Newton 2.1. Rosetta is generally considered a significant improvement and many reviewers, testers, and users consider the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition software better than any of the alternatives even 10 years after it was introduced. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>  Recognition and computation of handwritten horizontal and vertical formulas such as "1 + 2 =" was also under development but never released.</p>
<p>

A critical feature of the Newton handwriting recognition system is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../336/2311336.xml">
modeless</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../375/10375.xml">
error correction</link>. That is, correction done <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../978/379978.xml">
in situ</link> without using a separate window or widget, using a minimum of gestures. If a word is recognized improperly, the user could double-tap the word and a list of alternatives would pop up in a menu under the stylus. Most of the time, the correct word will be in the list. If not, a button at the bottom of the list allows the user to edit individual characters in that word. Other pen gestures could do such things as transpose letters (also <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../978/379978.xml">
in situ</link>).  The correction popup also allowed the user to revert to the original, un-recognized letter shapes - this would be useful in note-taking scenarios if there was insufficient time to make corrections immediately. To conserve memory and storage space, alternative recognition hypotheses would not be saved indefinitely. If you returned to a note a week later, for example, you would only see the best match. Error correction in many current handwriting systems provides such functionality but adds more steps to the process, greatly increasing the interruption to a user's workflow that a given correction requires.</p>

Text could also be entered by tapping with the stylus on a small on-screen pop-up <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../213/25213.xml">
QWERTY</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../148/4151148.xml">

graphics tablet</link>.  With "Shapes", Newton could recognize that the user was attempting to draw a circle, a line, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../621/23621.xml">
polygon</link>, etc, and it would clean them up into "perfect" <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../499/32499.xml">
vector</link> representations (with modifiable control points and defined vertices) of what the user was attempting to draw.  "Shapes" and "Sketches" could be <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../077/2937077.xml">
scaled</link> or deformed once drawn.  "Ink text" captured the user's free-hand writing but allowed it to be treated somewhat like recognized text when manipulating for later editing purposes ("ink text" supported <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/2446313.xml">
word wrap</link>, could be formatted to be bold, italic, etc). <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> At any time a user could also direct the Newton to recognize selected "ink text" and turn it into recognized text (deferred recognition).  A Newton Note document (or the notes attached to each contact in Names and each calendar event) could contain any mix of interleaved text, ink text, Shapes, and Sketches.</p>

 Operating system and programming environment </st>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../290/1052290.xml">
Newton OS</link> consists of three layers. At the lowest level, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/20023.xml">
microkernel</link> handles resources like tasks and memory. On top of the microkernel, the bulk of the operating system is implemented in <programming_language wordnetid="106898352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../038/72038.xml">
C++</link></programming_language>
, including the communications layer, handwriting recognition, and the <programming_language wordnetid="106898352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../545/60545.xml">
NewtonScript</link></programming_language>
 environment. The top layer consists of built-in and user installed applications written in NewtonScript.</p>
<p>

NewtonScript is an advanced <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../757/22757.xml">
object-oriented programming</link> language, developed by Apple employee <link>
Walter Smith</link> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>.  Some programmers complained at the $1000 cost of the Toolbox programming environment (later in the life of the Newton, the programming environment was made available free of charge). Additionally, it required learning a new way of programming. Despite this, many third party and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../567/27567.xml">
shareware</link> applications are available for Newton.</p>
<p>

The Newton Toolkit (NTK), an integrated environment tailored to the graphical nature of the Newton, was developed specifically for developing applications for the Newton and included a graphical view editor, a template browser, and an interactive inspector. Initially, it was only available for Macs, and later a Windows version was developed. The Technical Lead for the Newton Toolkit was Norberto Menendez; other engineers on the team were: Ben Sharpe and Peter Potrebic.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Data storage </st>
<p>

Data in Newton is stored in object-oriented databases known as <system wordnetid="104377057" confidence="0.8">
<artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">
<instrumentality wordnetid="103575240" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../133/12927133.xml">
soups</link></instrumentality>
</artifact>
</system>
. One of the innovative aspects of Newton is that soups are available to all programs; and programs can operate cross-soup; meaning that the calendar can refer to names in the address book; a note in the notepad can be converted to an appointment, and so forth; and the soups can be programmer-extended&mdash;a new address book enhancement can be built on the data from the existing address book.</p>
<p>

While the soup concept works well within the Newton system itself, it causes several issues. First, it makes it difficult to synchronize data with other systems, like a desktop <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/19006979.xml">
Macintosh</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../137/18457137.xml">
PC</link> since the data stored in soups does not correspond well with such file based systems. Apple's utility to perform this task, the Newton Connection Utility, was complex and was never completed to perform to the satisfaction of most users. The realization that a hand held computer needs to work within the existing data environment of its users was key to the success of the later <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../544/37544.xml">
Palm Pilot</link> platform. Difficulty in working and sharing data with other systems was a key contributor to Newton's demise.</p>
<p>

The second consequence of the data-object soup is that objects can extend built-in applications such as the address book so seamlessly that Newton users can not distinguish which program or add-on object is responsible for the various features on their own system. A user rebuilding their system after extended usage might find themselves unable to manually restore their system to the same functionality because some long-forgotten downloaded extension was missing. Data owned and used by applications and extensions themselves is tossed in the "Storage" area of the "Extras" drawer. There is no built-in distinction between types of data in that area. For example, an installed application's icon could be sitting right next to a database of addresses used by another installed extension further down the list.</p>
<p>

Finally, the data soup concept works well for data like addresses, which benefit from being shared cross-functionally, but it works poorly for discrete data sets like files and documents. Later, the 2.0 release of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../290/1052290.xml">
Newton OS</link> introduced Virtual Binary Objects to alleviate the problem of handling large data objects.</p>

While adding more weight to the Newtons than AAA batteries or custom battery packs, the choice of an easily replaceable/rechargeable cell format gives the user a still unsurpassed runtime and flexibility of power supply. This, together with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../595/50595.xml">
Flash memory</link> used as internal storage (if all cells lost their power, no data was lost due to the non-volatility of this storage), gave birth to the slogan "Newton never dies, it only gets new batteries".</p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../090/3675090.xml">
eMate 300</link> was a Newton device in a laptop form factor offered to schools in 1997 as an inexpensive ($799 US, originally sold to education markets only) and durable computer for classroom use. However, in order to achieve its low price, the eMate 300 did not have all the speed and features of the contemporary MessagePad equivalent, the MessagePad 2000. The eMate was cancelled along with the rest of the Newton line.</p>

</ss2>

<st>
Prototypes</st>
<p>

Many prototypes of additional Newton models were spotted. Most notable was a Newton tablet or "slate", a large, flat screen that could be written on. Others included a "Kids Newton" with side handgrips and buttons, "VideoPads" which would have incorporated a video camera and screen on their flip-top covers for two-way communications, the "Mini 2000" which would have been very similar to Palm Pilot, and the "NewtonPhone" (developed by <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/168632.xml">

) which incorporated a handset and a keyboard.</p>

</ss2>
</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Cases </st>
<p>

Apple and third parties marketed several "wallets" (cases) for the MessagePads, which would hold them securely along with the owner's credit cards, driver's license, business cards, and cash. These wallets were even larger than the MessagePads and even less able to fit in a pocket, so they were most often used as a protective case for the unit to shield it from bumps and scratches.  Some cases included a metal or plastic shield inside the fabric to protect the glass LCD screen.  The MessagePad has a receiver in the middle back to accept a pin that was mounted on the case.  This allowed the Newton to be held by the case without the use of adhesives or straps.</p>

 Market reception </st>
<p>

Although the Apple Newton was produced for six years, it was never as successful in the marketplace as Apple had hoped. This has been attributed to two primary reasons: the Newton's high price (which went up to $1000 when models 2000 and 2100 were introduced), and its large size (it failed the "pocket test" by not fitting in an average coat, shirt, or trouser pocket).</p>
<p>

The MessagePad and MessagePad 100 were also limited by the very short lifetime of their inadequate AAA batteries.</p>
<p>

Critics also panned the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/203619.xml">
handwriting recognition</link>, trumpeted in the Newton's marketing campaign, available in the debut models, and it was this problem that was skewered in the <comic_strip wordnetid="107003352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../838/29838.xml">

. Although the handwriting recognition was greatly improved in later models, these initial problems marred Newton's reputation in the eyes of the public, and PDAs would remain a niche product until <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 handwriting recognition system&mdash;which had been available first as a software package for the Newton&mdash;managed to restore the viability of the PDA market after Newton's commercial failure.

.</p>
<p>

Another factor which limited the Newton's appeal was that desktop connectivity was not included in the basic retail package.  Desktop computer synchronization hardware and software had to be purchased separately adding to the expense of the basic package.</p>
<p>

Later versions (OS 2.x) offered excellent handwriting recognition and modeless access to error correction, quite possibly a leading reason for the continued popularity of the device among Newton users.  Even given the age of the hardware and software, Newtons still demand a sale price on the used market far greater than that of comparatively aged PDAs produced by other companies. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../054/304054.xml">
As of 2004</link> the Newton 2000 and 2100 could still fetch a price, without accessories, of over $100. In 2006 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../836/385836.xml">

Speculation continued for several years that Apple might release a new PDA with some Newton technology or collaborate with Palm.  Feeding a bit of speculation, Apple put the "Print Recognizer" part of the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition system into <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../640/20640.xml">
Mac OS X</link> version 10.2 (known as "Jaguar"). It can be used with graphics tablets to seamlessly input handwritten printed text anywhere there was an insertion point on the screen. This technology, known as "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../948/1954948.xml">
Inkwell</link>", appears in the System Preferences whenever a tablet input device is plugged in. Whether Apple will ever extensively utilize such technology again in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../879/662879.xml">
handheld device</link> remains to be seen. However, in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../749/8841749.xml">
iPhone</link> 2.0 software release, Apple has incorporated Chinese character recognition, when drawn with a finger. An <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../803/239803.xml">
Easter egg</link> in Print Recognizer on the Newton (write "ROSETTA! ROSETTA! ROSETTA!", and the Newton will insert "ROSETTA! ROSETTA! Hey, that's me!" instead) was present in Inkwell in Mac OS 10.2 and 10.3, but seems to have been removed in 10.4. Larry Yaeger was the author of the original Rosetta recognizer on the Newton, and was also responsible for porting it to Mac OS X.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../990/2001990.xml">

At an All Things Digital conference in 2004, Steve Jobs made reference to a new "Apple PDA" (likely a successor to the Newton) which the company had developed but had decided not to bring to market.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>

Note(*): The eMate 300 actually has ROM Chips silked screened with 2.2 on them. Stephanie Mak on her website discusses this. http://www.felesmagus.com/newton/otheremate.html So if you remove ALL patches to the eMate 300 NOS you will end up with an NOS of 2.2.00-0 which is documented in photo located here.

Third Party Licenses</st>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../290/1052290.xml">
Newton OS</link> was also licensed to a number of third party developers including Sharp and Motorola who developed additional PDA devices that used the operating system. Motorola added wireless connectivity to the unit, and renamed it the Marco. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref></p>

There were a number of projects that used the Newton as a portable information device in cultural settings such as museums. For example, Visible Interactive created a walking tour in San Francisco's Chinatown but the most significant effort took place in <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 Discovery Center, known as Petrosains. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref></p>
<p>

In 1995, an exhibit design firm, DMCD Inc., was awarded the contract to design a new 100,000 square foot (9300&nbsp;m²) science museum in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../650/113650.xml">
Petronas Towers</link> in Kuala Lumpur. A major factor in the award was the concept that visitors would use a Newton to access additional information, find out where they were in the museum, listen to audio, see animations, control robots and other media, and to bookmark information for printout at the end of the exhibit.</p>
<p>

The device became known as the ARIF, a Malay word for "wise man" or "seer" and it was also an acronym for A Resourceful Informative Friend. Some 400 ARIFS were installed and over 300 are still in use today.  The development of the ARIF system was extremely complex and required a team of hardware and software engineers, designers, and writers. ARIF is an ancestor of the PDA systems used in museums today and it boasted features that have not been attempted since.</p>
