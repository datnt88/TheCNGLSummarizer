<p>

Shocks of magnitude&nbsp;3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude&nbsp;4 or above per day in early April, and 8&nbsp;per&nbsp;day the week before May 18.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../321/73321.xml">

By April 7 the combined crater was 1,700&nbsp;feet (520&nbsp;m) long, 1,200&nbsp;feet (365&nbsp;m) wide and 500&nbsp;feet (150&nbsp;m) deep.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../584/176584.xml">
USGS</link> team determined in the last week of April that a 1.5-mile (2.4&nbsp;km) diameter section of St. Helens' north face was displaced out at least 270&nbsp;feet (82&nbsp;m).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> For the rest of April and early May this bulge grew 5 to 6 ft (1.5 to 1.8&nbsp;m)  per day, and by mid-May it extended more than 400&nbsp;feet (120&nbsp;m) north.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> As the bulge moved northward, the summit area behind it progressively sank, forming a complex, down-dropped block called a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../980/495980.xml">
graben</link>. Geologists announced on April 30 that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest immediate danger and that such a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../208/37208.xml">
landslide</link> might spark an eruption. These changes in the volcano's shape were related to the overall deformation that increased the volume of the mountain by 0.03&nbsp;cubic miles (0.1&nbsp;km³) by mid-May.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> This volume increase presumably corresponded to the volume of magma that pushed into the volcano and deformed its surface. Because the intruded magma remained below ground and was not directly visible, it was called a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../996/867996.xml">
cryptodome</link>, in contrast to a true <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/1081235.xml">

A total of about 10,000 earthquakes were recorded prior to the May 18 event, with most concentrated in a small zone less than 1.6&nbsp;miles (2.6&nbsp;km) directly below the bulge.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> Visible eruptions ceased on May 16, reducing public interest and consequently the number of spectators in the area.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> Mounting public pressure then forced officials to allow 50 carloads of property owners to enter the danger zone on May 17 to gather whatever property they could carry.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> Another trip was scheduled for 10&nbsp;a.m. the next morning.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> Since that was Sunday, more than 300 loggers would not be working in the area. By the time of the climactic eruption, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/285235.xml">
dacite</link> magma intruding into the volcano had forced the north flank outward nearly 500&nbsp;feet (150&nbsp;m) and heated the volcano's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../927/262927.xml">

Most of St. Helens' former north side became a rubble deposit 17&nbsp;miles (27&nbsp;km) long, averaging 150&nbsp;feet (46&nbsp;m) thick; the slide was thickest at one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) below Spirit Lake and thinnest at its western margin. All the water in Spirit Lake was temporarily displaced by the landslide, sending 600-foot (180&nbsp;m) high waves crashing into a ridge north of the lake, adding 295&nbsp;feet (90&nbsp;m) of new avalanche debris above the old lakebed, and raising its surface level by about 200&nbsp;feet (60&nbsp;m). As the water moved back into its <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../162/191162.xml">
basin</link>, it pulled with it thousands of trees felled by a super-heated wall of volcanic gas and searing ash and rock that overtook the landslide seconds before.</p>

Everyone in the quiet zone could see the huge ash cloud that was sent skyward from St. Helens' northern foot. The near-supersonic lateral blast, loaded with volcanic debris, caused devastation as far as 19&nbsp;miles (30&nbsp;km) from the volcano. The area affected by the blast can be subdivided into three roughly concentric zones:

 Later flows </st>
<p>

Subsequent outpourings of pyroclastic material from the breach left by the landslide consisted mainly of new magmatic debris rather than fragments of preexisting volcanic rocks. The resulting deposits formed a fan-like pattern of overlapping sheets, tongues, and lobes. At least 17 separate pyroclastic flows occurred during the May 18 eruption, and their aggregate volume was about&nbsp;0.05 cubic miles (208,000,000&nbsp;m³).</p>
<p>

The flow deposits were still at about 300 °C to 420 °C (570 °F to 785 °F) two weeks after they erupted. Secondary steam-blast eruptions fed by this heat created pits on the northern margin of the pyroclastic-flow deposits, at the south shore of Spirit Lake, and along the upper part of the North Fork Toutle River. These steam-blast explosions continued sporadically for weeks or months after the emplacement of pyroclastic flows, and at least one occurred about a year later, on May 16, 1981.</p>

As the avalanche and initial pyroclastic flow were still advancing, a huge ash column grew to a height of 12&nbsp;miles (19&nbsp;km) above the expanding crater in less than 10&nbsp;minutes and spread <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../543/434543.xml">

Later, slower flows came directly from the new north-facing crater and consisted of glowing pumice bombs and very hot pumiceous ash. Some of these hot flows covered ice or water which flashed to steam, creating craters up to 65&nbsp;feet (20&nbsp;m) in diameter and sending ash as much as 6,500&nbsp;feet (1980&nbsp;m) into the air.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>

<p>

Removing and disposing of the ash was a monumental task for some eastern Washington communities. State and federal agencies estimated that over 2.4&nbsp;million&nbsp;cubic yards (1.8&nbsp;million&nbsp;m³) of ash&nbsp;&mdash; equivalent to about 900,000&nbsp;tons in weight&nbsp;&mdash; were removed from highways and airports in Washington.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref> Ash removal cost $2.2&nbsp;million and took 10&nbsp;weeks in Yakima.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref> The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites.

There were also indirect and intangible costs of the eruption. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../741/31741.xml">
Unemployment</link> in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, and then returned to nearly normal once timber salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway.

St. Helens produced five more explosive eruptions between May and October 1980. Through early 1990, a total of at least 21 periods of eruptive activity had occurred. The volcano remains active, with smaller, dome-building eruptions continuing into 2008.</p>

Eruption on July 22, 1980.

</image>

An eruption occurred on May 25, 1980 at 2:30&nbsp;a.m. that sent an ash column 9&nbsp;miles (14&nbsp;km) into the atmosphere.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref> The eruption was preceded by a sudden increase in earthquake activity and occurred during a rain storm. Erratic wind from the storm carried ash from the eruption to the south and west, lightly dusting large parts of western Washington and Oregon. Pyroclastic flows exited the northern breach and covered avalanche debris, lahars and other pyroclastic flows deposited by the May 18 eruption.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref></p>
<p>

At 7:05&nbsp;p.m. on June 12, a plume of ash billowed 2.5&nbsp;miles (4&nbsp;km) above the volcano. At 9:09&nbsp;p.m. a much stronger explosion sent an ash column about 10&nbsp;miles (16&nbsp;km) skyward.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref> This event caused the Portland area, previously spared by wind direction, to be thinly coated with ash in the middle of the annual Rose Festival.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref> A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/285235.xml">
dacite</link> dome then oozed into existence on the crater floor, growing to a height of 200&nbsp;feet (60&nbsp;m) and a width of 1,200&nbsp;feet (370&nbsp;m) within a week.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref></p>
<p>

A series of large explosions on July 22 broke more than a month of relative quiet. The July eruptive episode was preceded by several days of measurable expansion of the summit area, heightened earthquake activity, and changed emission rates of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/50958.xml">
sulfur dioxide</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../906/5906.xml">
carbon dioxide</link>. The first hit at 5:14&nbsp;p.m. as an ash column shot 10&nbsp;miles (16&nbsp;km) and was followed by a faster blast at 6:25&nbsp;p.m. that pushed the ash column above its previous maximum height in just 7.5&nbsp;minutes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref> The final explosion started at 7:01&nbsp;p.m. and continued for over two hours.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref> When the relatively small amount of ash settled over eastern Washington, the dome built in June was gone.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref></p>
<p>

</image>

Seismic activity and gas emission steadily increased in early August, and on August 7 at 4:26&nbsp;p.m., an ash cloud slowly expanded 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) into the sky.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> Small pyroclastic flows were sent through the northern breach and weaker outpouring of ash rose from the crater. This continued until 10:32&nbsp;p.m. when a second large blast sent ash high into the air.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> A second dacite dome filled this vent a few days later.</p>
<p>

Two months of repose were ended by an eruption lasting from October 16 to October 18. This event obliterated the second dome, sent ash 10&nbsp;miles (16&nbsp;km) in the air and created small, red-hot <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../762/417762.xml">
pyroclastic</link> flows.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> A third dome began to form within 30&nbsp;minutes after the final explosion on October 18, and within a few days, it was about 900&nbsp;feet (270&nbsp;m) wide and 130&nbsp;feet (40&nbsp;m) high. In spite of the dome growth next to it, <glacier wordnetid="109289331" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../816/9010816.xml">
a new glacier</link></glacier>
 formed rapidly inside the crater.</p>
<p>

All of the post-1980 eruptions were quiet dome-building events, beginning with the December 27, 1980, to January 3, 1981, episode. By 1987 the third dome had grown to be more than 3,000&nbsp;feet (900&nbsp;m) wide and 800&nbsp;feet (240&nbsp;m) high.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> At that rate, assuming additional destructive eruptions do not occur, St. Helens' summit would be restored to its previous height sometime in the mid to late 22nd century. </p>
<p>

Further eruptions occurred over a few months during 1989–1991, and the mountain became active again in late 2004.</p>
