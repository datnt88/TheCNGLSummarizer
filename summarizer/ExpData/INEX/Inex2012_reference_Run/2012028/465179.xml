<b>Lapilli</b> is a size classification term for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../543/434543.xml">
tephra</link>, which is material that falls out of the air during a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../571/32571.xml">
volcanic eruption</link>. Lapilli (singular: lapillus) means "little stones" in Latin. They are in some senses similar to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/462931.xml">
ooids</link> or <link>
pisoids</link> in calcareous sediments.</p>
<p>

By definition lapilli range in size from 2 mm to 64 mm in diameter<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../762/417762.xml">
pyroclastic</link> particle greater than 64 mm in diameter is correctly known as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../407/1933407.xml">
volcanic bomb</link> when molten, or a volcanic block when solid. Pyroclastic material with particles less than 2 mm in diameter is referred to as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../811/198811.xml">
volcanic ash</link>.</p>

Formation</st>
<p>

Lapilli are spheroid, teardrop, dumbbell, or button shaped droplets of molten or semi-molten <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../644/37644.xml">
lava</link> ejected from a volcanic eruption which fall to earth while still at least partially molten. These granules are not accretionary, but are the direct result of liquid rock cooling as it travels through the air. </p>
<p>

Lapilli <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../481/44481.xml">
tuffs</link> are a very common form of volcanic rock typical of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../124/54124.xml">
rhyolite</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../239/285239.xml">
andesite</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/285235.xml">
dacite</link> pyroclastic eruptions. Here, large thicknesses of lapilli can be deposited during a basal surge eruption.  Most lapilli tuffs which remain in ancient terrains are formed by the accumulation and <it>welding</it> of semi-molten lapilli into what is known as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../481/44481.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Welded+tuff%22])">
welded tuff</link>.</p>
<p>

The heat of the newly deposited volcanic pile tends to cause the semi-molten material to flatten out as they become welded. Welded tuff <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../205/3495205.xml">
textures</link> are distinctive (termed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/14222961.xml">
eutaxitic</link>), with flattened lapilli, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../345/3495345.xml">
fiamme</link>, blocks and bombs forming oblate to discus-shaped forms within layers. These rocks are quite indurated and tough, as opposed to non-welded lapilli tuffs which are unconsolidated and easily <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../696/9696.xml">
eroded</link>. </p>
<p>

<b>Accretionary Lapilli</b></p>
<p>

Rounded <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../543/434543.xml">
tephra</link> balls are called <it>accretionary lapilli</it> if they consist of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../811/198811.xml">
volcanic ash</link> particles. Accretionary lapilli are formed in an eruption column or cloud by moisture or electrostatic forces, with the volcanic ash nucleating on some object and then accreting to it in layers before the accretionary lapillus falls from the cloud.  Accretionary lapilli are like volcanic hailstones that form by the addition of concentric layers of moist ash around a central nucleus. </p>
<p>

This texture can be confused with <link>
spherulitic</link> and <link>
axiolitic</link> texture.</p>

<p>

<b>Armoured (or cored) Lapilli</b></p>
<p>

This lapilli is a variety of accretionary lapilli, though contains lithic or crystal cores which are coated by rinds of coarse to fine ash. Armoured lapilli ONLY occurs in hydroclastic eruptions where significant moisture is present. The vapour column contains cohesive ash which sticks to particles within it.</p>
