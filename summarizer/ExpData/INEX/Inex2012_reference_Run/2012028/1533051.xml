An <b>eruption column</b> consists of hot <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../811/198811.xml">
volcanic ash</link> emitted during an explosive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/8921015.xml">
volcanic eruption</link>.  The ash forms a column rising many kilometres into the air above the peak of the volcano.  In the most explosive eruptions, the eruption column may rise over 40 km, penetrating the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../454/47454.xml">
stratosphere</link>.  Stratospheric injection of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../688/286688.xml">
aerosols</link> by volcanoes is a major cause of short-term <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../512/47512.xml">
climate change</link>.<p>

A common occurrence in explosive eruptions is for <it>column collapse</it> to occur.  In this case, the eruption column is too dense to be lifted high into the air by air convection, and instead falls down the flanks of the volcano to form a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../520/206520.xml">
pyroclastic flow</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../819/427819.xml">
surge</link>.</p>

Formation</st>

<p>

Eruption columns form in explosive volcanic activity, when the high concentration of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../968/9446968.xml">
volatile materials</link> in the rising <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../508/37508.xml">
magma</link> caused it to be disrupted into fine <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../811/198811.xml">
volcanic ash</link> and coarser <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../543/434543.xml">
tephra</link>.  The ash and tephra are ejected at speeds of several hundred metres per second, and can rise rapidly to heights of several kilometres, lifted by enormous <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../526/47526.xml">
convection</link> currents.</p>
<p>

Eruption columns may be transient, if formed by a discrete explosion, or sustained, if produced by a continuous eruption or closely spaced discrete explosions.</p>

Structure</st>

<p>

The solid or liquid material in an eruption column is lifted by processes which vary as the material ascends:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 At the base of the plume, material is forced upwards out of the vent by the pressure of expanding gas, mainly steam.  The gas expands because the pressure of rock above it rapidly reduces as it approaches the surface.  This region is called the <it>gas thrust region</it> and typically reaches to only one or two kilometres above the vent.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 The <it>convective thrust region</it> covers most of the height of the plume.  The gas thrust region is very turbulent and surrounding air becomes mixed into it and heated. The air expands, reducing its density and rising.  The rising air carries the solid and liquid material from the eruption entrained in it upwards.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 As the plume rises into less dense surrounding air, it will eventually reach an altitude where the hot, rising air is of the same density as the surrounding cooler air.  In this neutral buoyancy region, the erupted material will then no longer rise through convection, but solely through any upward momentum which it has. This is called the <it>umbrella region</it>, and is usually marked by the column spreading out sideways.  The eruptive material and the surrounding cool air has the same density at the base of the umbrella region, and the top is marked by the maximum height which momentum carries the material erupted.  Because the speeds are very low, or negligible in this region it is often distorted by stratospheric winds.</entry>

The column will stop rising once it reaches an altitude where it is no longer less dense than the surrounding air. Several factors control the height that an eruption column can reach.</p>
<p>

Intrinsic factors include the diameter of the erupting vent, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../869/18993869.xml">
gas</link> content of the magma, and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../357/32357.xml">
velocity</link> at which it is ejected.  Extrinsic factors can be important, with winds sometimes limiting the height of the column, and the local thermal temperature gradient also playing a role.  The atmospheric temperature in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../822/41822.xml">
troposphere</link> normally decreases by about 6-7&nbsp;<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/19593121.xml">
K</link>/km, but small changes in this gradient can have a large effect on the final column height.  Theoretically, the maximum achievable column height is thought to be about 55 km.  In practice, column heights ranging from about 2-45&nbsp;km are seen.</p>
<p>

Eruption columns over 10-15&nbsp;km high break through the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../615/140615.xml">
tropopause</link> and inject ash and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../688/286688.xml">
aerosols</link> into the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../454/47454.xml">
stratosphere</link>.  Ash and aerosols in the troposphere are quickly removed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../110/19009110.xml">
rain</link> and other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../260/286260.xml">
precipitation</link>, but material injected into the stratosphere is much more slowly dispersed, in the absence of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../978/33978.xml">
weather</link> systems.  Substantial amounts of stratospheric injection can have global effects: after <amorphous_shape wordnetid="113867492" confidence="0.8">

 erupted in 1991, global temperatures dropped by about 0.5°C.  The largest eruptions are thought to cause drops of up to several degrees, and are potentially the cause of some of the known <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../813/9813.xml">
mass extinction</link>s.</p>
<p>

Eruption column heights are a useful way of measuring eruption intensity since for a given atmospheric temperature, the column height is proportional to the fourth power of the mass eruption rate. Consequently, given similar conditions, to double the column height requires an eruption ejecting 16 times as much material per second. The column height of eruptions which have not been observed can be estimated by mapping the <it>maximum</it> distance that pyroclasts of different sizes are carried from the vent &ndash; the higher the column the further ejected material of a particular mass (and therefore size) can be carried.</p>
<p>

The approximant maximum height of a eruption column is given by the equation.</p>
<p>

H = k(MΔT)1/4  </p>
<p>

Where:
K is a constant that depends on various properties, such as atmospheric conditions.
M is the mass eruption rate.
ΔT is the difference in temperature between the erupting magma and the surrounding atmosphere.</p>

Hazards</st>

<ss1>

Column collapse</st>

<p>

Eruption columns may become so laden with dense material that they are too heavy to be supported by convection currents.  This can suddenly happen if, for example, the rate at which magma is erupted increases to a point where insufficient air is entrained to support it, or if the magma density suddenly increases as denser magma from lower down in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../143/3864143.xml">
stratified</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../892/527892.xml">
magma chamber</link> is tapped.</p>
<p>

If it does happen, then material reaching the bottom of the convective thrust region can no longer be adequately supported by convection and will fall under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../579/38579.xml">
gravity</link>, forming a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../520/206520.xml">
pyroclastic flow</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../819/427819.xml">
surge</link> which can travel down the flanks of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../571/32571.xml">
volcano</link> at speeds of over 100&nbsp;km/hour.  Column collapse is one of the most common and dangerous volcanic hazards in a plinian eruption.</p>

Aircraft</st>

Several eruptions have seriously endangered aircraft which have encountered the eruption column.  In two separate incidents in 1982, an airliner flew into the upper reaches of an eruption column generated by <amorphous_shape wordnetid="113867492" confidence="0.8">

, and the ash severely damaged both aircraft. Particular hazards were the ingestion of ash stopping the engines, the sandblasting of the cockpit windows rendering them largely opaque and the contamination of fuel through the ingestion of ash through pressurisation ducts. The damage to engines is a particular problem since temperatures inside a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../664/58664.xml">
gas turbine</link> are sufficiently high that volcanic ash is melted in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../179/441179.xml">
combustion chamber</link>, and forms a glass coating on components further downstream of it, for example on turbine blades.</p>
<p>

In one case, the aircraft lost power on all four engines, and in the other, three of the four engines failed.  In both cases, engines were successfully restarted but the aircraft were forced make emergency landings in <state wordnetid="108654360" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 in 1989.  Following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, aircraft were diverted to avoid the eruption column, but nonetheless, ash dispersing over a wide area caused damage to 16 aircraft, some as far as 1000&nbsp;km from the volcano.</p>

Eruption plumes are not usually visible on weather radar and may be obscured by cloud or night.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>  Because of the risks posed to aviation by eruption plumes, there is a network of nine <link>
