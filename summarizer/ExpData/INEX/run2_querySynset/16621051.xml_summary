The NT$2,000 was initially the only banknote to feature a holographic strip, being the highest denomination banknote in public circulation.
First introduced in 15 December 2000 for general circulation, the Central Bank of China relaunched the banknote with holographic strip and a darker colour due to counterfeiting concerns and possible confusion with the NT$100 banknote.
First introduced in 1 July 2002, de-facto this banknote does not appear common to the public possibly due to its new denomination and fears of losses through receiving a large-value counterfeit banknote.
