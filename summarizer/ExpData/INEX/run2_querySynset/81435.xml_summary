Super Princess Peach marked the second time that Princess Peach was cast as the main hero in a video game, as Princess Peach had to save Mario and Luigi from King Bowser.
Finally, she also appears in the first Mario basketball game, Mario Hoops 3-on-3, for the Nintendo DS, and is a technical type (good at shooting).
Some of her attacks include the Peach Bomber, her parasol, her back throw using Toad as a human shield, her aerial back attack using golf clubs and frying pan as mêlée weapons, and pulling vegetables from the ground.
