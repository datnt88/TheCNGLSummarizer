Many donors donate as an act of charity, but some are paid and in some cases there are incentives other than money.
Using this method an individual can donate plasma or platelets much more frequently than they can safely donate whole blood.
For example, plasma donors in the United States are allowed to donate large volumes twice a week and could nominally give 83 liters in a year, whereas the same donor in Japan may only donate every other week and could only donate about 16 liters in a year.
