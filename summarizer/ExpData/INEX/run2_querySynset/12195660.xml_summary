John Mark Purdey (December 25 1953 â€“ November 12 2006) was a British organic farmer who came to public attention in the 1980s, when he began to investigate the causes of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow disease").
His early self-funded research concluded that BSE was not an infectious disease, contrary to the mainstream scientific view, but that it had an environmental cause.
Purdey began to educate himself about the science of OPs just as the first recorded case of BSE was confirmed.
