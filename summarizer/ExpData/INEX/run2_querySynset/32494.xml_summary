vi is a screen-oriented text editor written by Bill Joy in 1976 for an early BSD release.
Any text typed thence gets added to the document, until the escape key is pressed, at which point the insert mode is exited and vi switches to normal mode. (There are few more commands that switch the editor into insert mode, but they differ only in where the new text will go - before the cursor, after the cursor, above current line, below current line, etc.).
Support for regular expressions (or text patterns) is an important feature of vi. These can be used extensively in search, substitution and global search and replace commands.
