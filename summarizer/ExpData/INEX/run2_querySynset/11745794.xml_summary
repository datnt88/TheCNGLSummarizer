At the time the Fund was established, the Academy defined its role as making “more widely known throughout Australia the benefits that accrue both internationally and to Australia from international agricultural research, and to encourage greater support for, and participation in, international agricultural R&amp;D by Australian governmental and non-governmental organisations and, in particular, the industrial, farming and scientific communities in Australia”.
Two kinds of training are provided:  • About 25 Training Awards are made each year to enable individual researchers from developing countries to undertake customised training in Australia in specific aspects of a wide range of topics in agriculture, forestry and horticulture.
Awarded biennially, the Derek Tribe Award is presented to a senior researcher from a developing country, and the Crawford Fellowship is presented to a young researcher from a developing country.
