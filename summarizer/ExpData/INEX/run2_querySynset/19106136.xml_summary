The Honduran banana industry employed a significant Garifuna workforce from the Bay Islands off Trujillo and in 1901 the government gave concessions for them to use over 7,000 hectares for banana cultivation.
In 2003, the News Scientist reported that global banana production was underthreat by disease and may be wiped out within ten years if preventative measures for not taken to protect against it.
This FHIA banana crop is resistant to major diseases and pests, but is also highly highly productive and efficient.
