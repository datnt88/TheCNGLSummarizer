Lan becomes devoted to Galactus, and on one journey to seek a planet for sustenance for Galactus, battles the alien race the Ovoids.
The Ovoids manage to kill Lan, but not before Galactus retrieves and transfers the last spark of Lan's soul to an android body.
Dissatisfied with the android, Galactus sends it to Earth to re-enlist the Silver Surfer as his Herald.
