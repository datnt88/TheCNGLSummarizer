It is the thirtieth animated feature produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation.
It is the first and only full-length animated feature film to ever be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture (it lost to The Silence of the Lambs).
It was also the most successful animated Disney film at the time and the first animated movie to reach $100 million at the domestic box-office.
