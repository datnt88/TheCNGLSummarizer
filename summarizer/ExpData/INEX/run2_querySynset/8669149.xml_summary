Criticism of sport utility vehicles is the expression (made by various groups, organizations or individuals) of disapproval of sport utility vehicles (SUVs).
SUV safety concerns are compounded by a perception among some consumers that SUVs are safer for their drivers than standard cars.
These figures may be compounded by variables other than the vehicles' inherent safety, for example the documented tendency for SUVs to be driven more recklessly (most sensationally perhaps, the 1996 finding that SUV drivers are more likely to drive drunk).
