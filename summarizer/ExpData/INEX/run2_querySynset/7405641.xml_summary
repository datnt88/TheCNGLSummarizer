Cyclotron is the name of two incarnations of the same fictional DC Comics character, Terry Curtis.
Roy Thomas reinvented the character as Cyclotron, a reluctant supervillain, in All-Star Squadron #21 (1983) from DC Comics.
Cyclotron died trying to be a hero by taking the Humanite into the atmosphere and allowing himself to blow up.
