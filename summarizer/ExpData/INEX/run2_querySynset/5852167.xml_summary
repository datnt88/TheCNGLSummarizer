They were probably larger than almost all living penguins, with the smaller species being about the size of an Emperor Penguin and the largest ones having stood about 1.5 meters tall.
The genus is the namesake for the subfamily of primitive penguins, Palaeeudyptinae.
The exact nature of the relationship of the Palaeeudyptinae to modern penguins is unknown.
