The face of the banknote has a portrait of writer Karen Blixen (17 April 1885 to 7 September 1962).
The face of the banknote is also decorated with flowers, of which Karen Blixen was very fond.
The Danish National bank first used it on the 50 krone banknote issued in 1957, and the present banknote is thus the third to use this word.
