A colony of little blue penguins lives on the harbour, and a colony of yellow-eyed penguins just south of the town attracts ecotourists.
Penguins sometimes live under buildings close to the beach, including the town's music club, The Penguin Club.
The town also falls within the coverage area of Radio Dunedin and the circulation-area of the Otago Daily Times, based in Dunedin.
