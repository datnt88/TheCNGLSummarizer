In the Victorian era Penge developed into a fashionable suburb because of its proximity to the relocated Crystal Palace.
By 1862 Stanford's map of Londonhttp://www.mappalondon.com/london/south-east/map-london.htm shows large homes had been constructed along Penge New Road (now Crystal Palace Park Road and Penge High Street), Thick Wood (now Thicket) Road and Anerley Road.
After the Crystal Palace was moved to Penge, a fashionable day out was to visit the Crystal Palace during the day and to take the tram down the hill to one of the 'twenty-five pubs to the square mile'or two Music Halls - The King's Hall and the Empire Theatre (later the Essoldo cinema) http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/penge/empire-theatre.htmhttp://viewfinder.english-heritage.org.uk/search/reference.asp?index=565&amp;main_query=&amp;theme=&amp;period=&amp;county=&amp;district=&amp;place_name=London&amp;imageUID=77020&amp;=&amp;JS=True.
