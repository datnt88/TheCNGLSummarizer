The Glaspalast (Glass Palace) was a glass and iron exhibition building in Munich modeled after The Crystal Palace in London.
The Erste Allgemeine Deutsche Industrieausstellung was opened five weeks later, only three years after the completion of the Crystal Palace in London, which served as model.
The building was destroyed in a fire on July 6, 1931, a fate shared with the other crystal palaces.
