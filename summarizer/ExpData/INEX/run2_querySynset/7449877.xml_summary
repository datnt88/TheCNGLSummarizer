Born at Marton, New Zealand and educated at Wanganui, he became a teacher based in Dunedin after obtaining a diploma in 1922 from Hawkesbury Agricultural College near Sydney, Australia.
Richdale's main ornithological interest was in seabirds, especially penguins and petrels, and he was engaged in long-term studies of various species for most of his life.
In addition, he authored two major books, "Sexual Behavior in Penguins" (University of Kansas Press, 1951), and "A Population Study of Penguins" (Clarendon Press, 1957).
