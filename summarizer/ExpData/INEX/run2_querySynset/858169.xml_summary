It was while studying at St. Louis University, in 1949, that he would be asked by Father William S. Bowdern to assist in the exorcism rite on a case, which would become famous, concerning a thirteen year old boy.
Although the weeks in which he helped with this case of possession would make him a reluctant minor celebrity he regarded the exorcism as just one event in his life and not the most important.
In the publicity run up to the airing of the film, various television shows covered the topic of demonic possession with both Father Halloran and Thomas B. Allen appearing in segments speaking about the case.
