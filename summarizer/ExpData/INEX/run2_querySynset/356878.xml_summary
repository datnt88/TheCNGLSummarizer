Xcode is a suite of tools for developing software on Mac OS X, developed by Apple.
Version 3.0 is not supported on older Mac OS versions, for which Xcode is also available for free from Apple Developer Connection.
The Xcode suite includes a modified version of free software GNU Compiler Collection (GCC, apple-darwin9-gcc-4.0.1 as well as apple-darwin9-gcc-4.2.1, with the former being the default), and supports C, C++, Fortran, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Java, AppleScript, Python and Ruby source code with a variety of programming models, including but not limited to Cocoa, Carbon, and Java.
