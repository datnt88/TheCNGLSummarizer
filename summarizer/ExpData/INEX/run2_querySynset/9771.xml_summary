ed is the standard text editor on the Unix operating system.  ed was originally written by Ken Thompson and contains one of the first implementations of regular expressions.
Prior to that implementation, the concept of regular expressions was only formalized in a mathematical paper, which Ken Thompson had read. ed was influenced by an earlier editor known as QED from University of California at Berkeley, Ken Thompson's alma mater. ed went on to influence ex, which in turn spawned vi. The non-interactive Unix commands grep and sed were inspired by common special uses of ed; their influence is visible in the design of the programming language AWK, which in turn inspired aspects of Perl.
