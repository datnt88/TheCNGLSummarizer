The Demon Murder Trial is the first known case in the United States of a lawyer claiming his client was innocent due to demonic possession.
Minella traveled to England to meet with lawyers who had been involved in two similar cases (though neither ever went to trial), planned to fly in exorcism specialists from Europe, and threatened to subpoena the priests involved if they would not cooperate.
Johnson and his wife Debbie believe the account of demonic possession to be true, and that Glatzel is suing to make money.
