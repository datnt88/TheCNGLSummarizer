The brand's popularity has led to its becoming a generic term for gelatin dessert across the US and Canada.
The powder contains powdered gelatin and flavorings including sugar or artificial sweeteners.
It also made gelatin desserts the province of the relatively well-to-do. In 1845, industrialist Peter Cooper (who built the first American steam-powered locomotive, the Tom Thumb), obtained a patent (US Patent 4084) for powdered gelatin.
