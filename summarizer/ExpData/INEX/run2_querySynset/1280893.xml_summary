A cooking apple is an apple that is used primarily for cooking rather than eating fresh.
Other variety such as Bramley or Golden Noble are cut into small segments for pies, tarts etc. Bramley is by far the most popular cooking apple in the UK, as it grows easily to a large size, keeps well and cooks well.
Apples can be baked in an oven and served with custard or put into an apple pie or apple crumble.
