SRY (Sex-determining Region Y) is a sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome in the therians (placental mammals and marsupials).
This intronless gene encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the high mobility group (HMG)-box family of DNA-binding proteins.
This protein is the testis determining factor (TDF), also referred to as the SRY protein, which initiates male sex determination.
