For the 1995 model year, a new SE model was added, intended to be a budget version of the SHO. It was a step above the entry level GL, a step below the top of the line LX, and came standard with front bucket seats and a center console with a floor mounted shifter, as well as a rear spoiler borrowed from the SHO. The SE was never available as a wagon.
