In 123 B.C. the Romans founded Aix-en-Provence, and two years later began a new town at Nemausa (today Nimes.)  The Roman colony known as Provincia was organized in about 120 B.C.  A Roman road, the Via Domitia, named for Roman Consul Domitius Ahenobarbus, was built to connect Rome with the Pyrenees, following the path of the old Greek Way of Hercules.
The Roman aqueduct of Pont du Gard (first century AD), built during the time of the Emperor Claudius, is one of the most impressive examples of Roman civil engineering.
