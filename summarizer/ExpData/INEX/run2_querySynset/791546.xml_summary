The "classic" ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate.
Wilder's colleague, paediatrician Mynie Peterman, later formulated the "classic" diet, with a ratio of one gram of protein per kg of body weight in children, 10–15 g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat.
Achieving the balance of fat, protein and carbohydrate can be difficult; patients may consume the appetising protein (meat) and leave or vomit the fat.
