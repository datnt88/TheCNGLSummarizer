Ted Bloecher (born 1929) is an American ufologist.
Researcher Jerome Clark described him as "highly regarded" for his scientific rigor, his detailed research, his efforts at balance and neutrality, and his reluctance to speculate beyond what is supported by given data.
In the early 1980s, Bloecher retired from ufology, donating his files to CUFOS.
