The James Bond film series are spy films inspired by Ian Fleming's novels about the fictional MI6 agent Commander James Bond (codename 007).
For the lead Bond girl “Domino”, a slew of top female actresses were considered including Raquel Welch, Julie Christie, and Faye Dunaway but the role went to former Miss France Claudine Auger.
Sylvia Trench is the only recurring Bond girl (Bond's off-assignment girlfriend) while Swedish actress Maud Adams has played two different Bond girls in two films, The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy.
