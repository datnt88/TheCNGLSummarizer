Mary Elizabeth "Mimi" Smith (née Stanley) (1903 – 6 December 1992) is best known as the maternal aunt and parental guardian of the English musician John Lennon.
After Julia separated from Alf Lennon, she and the infant Lennon moved in with Julia's new lover, John Albert "Bobby" Dykins.
With help from Mimi and Lennon's headmaster, Lennon was accepted into the Liverpool College of Art as Mimi was insistent that Lennon should have some sort of academic qualifications, but Lennon was beginning to show an interest in music.
