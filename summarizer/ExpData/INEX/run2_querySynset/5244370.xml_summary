East of the Andes in Peru is what is regarded as the most important biodiversity hotspot in the world with its unique forests that form the western edge of the world's largest rainforest, the Amazon Rainforest.
East of the Andes is a large lowland drained by a small number of rivers, including the two largest in the world by drainage area - the Amazon River and the more southerly Paran√° River.
The largest country in South America by far, in both area and population, is Brazil, followed by Argentina.
