vile is a text editor that attempts to combine the best aspects of the popular Emacs and vi editors.
These editors are traditionally located on opposing sides of the editor wars, as users of Emacs and vi tend to have strong sentiments against the editor they do not use; however, vile at least attempts to reconcile these positions.
vile is an acronym which stands for "VI Like Emacs".  vile is featured in Chapter 12 of the O'Reilly book "Learning the vi Editor".
