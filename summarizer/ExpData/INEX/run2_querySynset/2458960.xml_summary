Anneliese Michel (September 21, 1952 â€“ July 1, 1976) was a German  Catholic woman who was said to be possessed by demons and subsequently underwent an exorcism.
Having centered her life around devout Catholic faith, Anneliese began to attribute her condition to demonic possession.
Anneliese became intolerant of sacred places and objects,  such as the crucifix, which she attributed to her own demonic possession.
