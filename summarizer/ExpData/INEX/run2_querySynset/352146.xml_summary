He discovered the phenomenon of the electrochemical branching of the radioactive rows.
Afterwards Fajans was working on the electrochemical properties of elements as a result of the radioactive changes, and he formulated the law of the radioactive moves which was later named the Soddy-Fajans Method (Frederick Soddy received the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1921 for his isotopic research).
It is very significant in the context of radiochemical methods of separating and cleaning radioactive substances found in the smallest number.
