Demonic possession is often the term used to describe the control over a human form by Satan himself or one of his assigned advocates.
Demonic possession is mentioned at length in Carlos Castanedaâ€™s The Active Side of Infinity, in which it is claimed that human civilization is demonic in origin.
Those who profess a belief in demonic possession have sometimes ascribed the symptoms associated with mental illnesses such as hysteria, mania, psychosis, or dissociative identity disorder to possession.
