Practically alone of all major Bond Girls of the Fleming canon, Gala Brand has not appeared as a character in a James Bond film, the movie version of the novel being an almost total rewrite of the book Moonraker''.
The only other Bond girl of the Fleming novels to share this fate is Vivienne Michel of the novel The Spy Who Loved Me.
Gala is the most professional of all of Fleming's Bond Girls, being practically the only one to have an independent career.
