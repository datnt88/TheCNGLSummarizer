Karolina Gočeva got her first break at the age of 10 when she performed at the children's festival "Si-Do" in Bitola and the annual festival "Makfest 91" in Štip with the song "Mamo, pušti me" ("Mum, let me go").
Karolina released several singles off her first album, including "Sakaj me" ("Love me"), "Bez ogled na se"("No matter what") and "Nemir" ("Restless"), the latter of which she sang in a duet with Toše Proeski.
