Pac-Mania is an arcade video game in the Pac-Man series, released in 1987 by Namco and distributed by Atari Games in the United States and Europe.
It is a pseudo-3D interpretation of the classic maze game genre and features most elements of the original Pac-Man, as well as several new features.
The game takes place in four environments: "Block Town" (made up of Lego-like building blocks), "Pac-Man Theatre" (a 3D version of the original Pac-Man maze), "Sandbox Land" (walls are made up of pyramids), and "Jungly Steps" (appearing as pathways with no railings, resembling a set of steps that rise toward the back of the maze).
