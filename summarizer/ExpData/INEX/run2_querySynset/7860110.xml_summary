Human sex determination refers to the processes by which an individual becomes either a male or female during development.
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, coinciding with the mapping of the human genome, researchers began to look for the specific gene on the Y chromosome that, up until then, had been known as the testis determining factor (TDF).
However, Dr. MS Palmer later discovered a ZFY analogue on the X chromosome, providing evidence that ZFY was in fact not the TDF. Eventually, Dr. Peter Koopman was able to prove that the SRY gene is the TDF from studies on XX males..
