The phrase panda car refers to a small or medium-sized police car operated by British police forces.
The boot lids, bonnets and doors were then swapped to create a panda car style scheme.http://www.imps4ever.info/misc/police.html#police
Current usage within the Metropolitan Police Service uses the term "panda car" to refer specifically to a marked car driven by a basic driver (i.e. one constrained to drive within normal traffic rules, and who may not use the vehicle's siren), as opposed to an IRV - "immediate response vehicle" - which could be exactly the same vehicle but driven by an advanced driver (i.e. one trained and permitted to disregard certain traffic laws and use the siren, as one would normally expect from police vehicles).
