Commonly associated with explosive volcanic activity - such as Plinian or krakatoan eruption styles, or phreatomagmatic eruptions - pyroclastic deposits are commonly formed from airborne ash, lapilli and bombs or blocks ejected from the volcano itself, mixed in with shattered country rock.
Pyroclasts of different sizes are classified as volcanic bombs, lapilli and volcanic ash.
Ash is considered to be pyroclastic because it is a fine dust made up of volcanic rock.
