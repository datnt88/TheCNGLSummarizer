Mario Golf is a sports video game series that was developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo.
It began on the Nintendo 64 with two games, one for the N64 and the other for the Game Boy Color.
The N64 and Game Boy Color versions can communicate each other via Transfer Pak connectivity, and the GameCube and GBA versions can do the same via the Nintendo GameCube-Game Boy Advance cable.
