Cynthia Lennon (née Powell) (born 10 September 1939 in Blackpool, Lancashire, England) is the former wife of John Lennon.
Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon) but Lennon accused Cynthia of an affair in India—saying that she was no "innocent little flower".
During Lennon's separation from Yoko in 1973 and 1974, his girlfriend, May Pang, actively tried to get Lennon to spend more time with Julian, forming a friendship with Cynthia in the process, which continued even after Lennon and Yoko had reconciled.
