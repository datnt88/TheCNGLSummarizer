It was first performed in Moscow on 8 January 1972 by the All-Union Radio and Television Symphony Orchestra under Maxim Shostakovich.
The movement opens with two chimes on the glockenspiel, and a lengthy passage for the solo flute, growing out of a quirky motif which flits between Ab-major and A-minor (connected by a C-natural), accompanied by slow-changing but lively chords for pizzicato strings.
The symphony is notable for many things, among them its eerie coda on a sustained pedal point in the strings supporting an astonishing percussion toccata featuring castanets, snare drum, wood block, xylophone, and triangle; this recalls the final moments of the scherzo from the Fourth Symphony, as well as those of a much more recent and similarly morbid work, the Second Cello Concerto.
