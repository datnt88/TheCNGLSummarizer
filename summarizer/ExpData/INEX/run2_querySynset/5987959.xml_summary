Julia Stanley Lennon (née Stanley) (12 March 1914 – 15 July 1958) was the mother of John Lennon.
Lennon chose Alf (twice) and then Julia walked away, but in the end Lennon (crying) followed her.
Julia remembered that after Lennon had visited them, her mother would often play a record called, My Son John, To Me You Are So Wonderful, "by some old crooner, and sit and listen to it". (Julia probably meant "My Son John"—sung by  David Whitfield—which was released in 1956).
