The U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) reports that  "Although there is no evidence that alcohol itself is a carcinogen, alcohol may act as a cocarcinogen by enhancing the carcinogenic effects of other chemicals. For example, studies indicate that alcohol enhances tobacco's ability to stimulate tumor formation in rats.  In humans, the risk for mouth, tracheal, and esophageal cancer is 35 times greater for people who both smoke and drink than for people who neither smoke nor drink,  implying a cocarcinogenic interaction between alcohol and tobacco-related carcinogens."
"Considering total alcohol drinking, the relative risk for alcohol drinkers vs. nondrinkers was 1.3 â€¦ No relation emerged between duration of alcohol consumption and risk of endometrial cancer. These findings suggest a potential link between alcohol drinking and endometrial cancer risk and are, in any case, inconsistent with a protective role of alcohol in endometrial carcinogenesis."
A study of men in the US found that consumption of wine, but not beer or spirits, was associated with a reduced NHL risk  and a large European  study found a protective effect of alcohol among men and in non-Mediterranean countries.." A study of older women in Iowa found alcohol to reduce the risk of NHL and the amount of alcohol  consumed, rather than the type of alcohollic beverages, appeared to be the main determinant in reducing risk. ."
