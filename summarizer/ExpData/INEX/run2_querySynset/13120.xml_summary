Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago.
He held more than 40 patents â€” among them the only patents ever issued for chemical elements, americium and curium.
He influenced the naming of so many elements that with the announcement of seaborgium, it was noted in Discover magazines review of the year in science that he could receive a letter addressed in chemical elements: seaborgium, lawrencium (for the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory where he worked), berkelium, californium, americium.
