MEGA Brands, Incorporated TSX:Â MB (Formerly MEGA Bloks, Incorporated) is a publicly traded children's toy company based in Montreal, Canada.
Mega Bloks is the name of their most popular toy, plastic building blocks.
The LEGO Group has filed suit against Mega Bloks Inc. in courts around the world on the grounds that Mega Bloks' use of the "studs and tubes" interlocking brick system is a violation of trademarks held by LEGO.  Generally such suits have been unsuccessful, chiefly because the functional design of the basic brick is considered a matter of patent rather than trademark law, and all relevant LEGO patents have expired.
