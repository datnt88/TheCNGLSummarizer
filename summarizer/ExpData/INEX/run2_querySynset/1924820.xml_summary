"The Seinfeld Chronicles" (also known as "Good News, Bad News" for syndication) is the pilot episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld.
The pilot, the first of the 180 Seinfeld episodes, was written by  Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, and was directed by Art Wolff.
However, the production staff and writers refer to the pilot as The Seinfeld Chronicles, to avoid confusion with a later Seinfeld episode called "The Pilot".
