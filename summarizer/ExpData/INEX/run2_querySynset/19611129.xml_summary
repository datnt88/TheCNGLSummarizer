Sleepy People (later renamed Blue Apple Boy) were/are a British psychedelic rock band known for their eccentric and energetic songs and live act, and for incubating three of the five future members of short-lived (but briefly famous) Britpop band Ultrasound.
In 1994, the band issued their first album Blunt Nails In A Sharp Wall on self-released cassette.
In 2000, Sleepy People changed their name to Blue Apple Boy (a name apparently based on Masonic imagery).
