For example, some SUVs and pickup trucks ride higher than cars and lack crumple zones to absorb impact energy.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have done studies of the aggressiveness of vehicle designs.
A 2003 NHTSA study estimated that in vehicle to vehicle crashes, the design of minivans was 1.16 times as aggressive as cars, pickups were 1.39 times more aggressive, and SUVs were 1.71 times more aggressive than cars.
