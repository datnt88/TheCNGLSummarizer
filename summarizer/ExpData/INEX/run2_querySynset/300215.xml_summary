A thesis or dissertation committee is a committee that supervises a student's dissertation.
In France, the academic dissertation or thesis is called a th√®se while the word dissertation is reserved for shorter (1,000-2,000 words), more generic exercises of logical demonstration.
A Bachelor thesis is often 40-60 pages, a Diplom or Master thesis at least 100 pages.
