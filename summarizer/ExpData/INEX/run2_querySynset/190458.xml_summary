Acids can catalyse the reaction by donating a proton to the carbonyl group, thus making it more reactive, while bases can catalyse the reaction by removing a proton from the alcohol, thus making it more reactive.
In the 1940s, researchers were looking for a method to more readily produce glycerine, which was used to produce explosives for World War II. Many of the methods used today by producers and homebrewers have their origin in the original 1940s research.
Biolipid transesterification has also been recently shown by Japanese researchers to be possible using a super-critical methanol methodology, whereby high temperature, high-pressure vessels are used to physically catalyze the biolipid/methanol reaction into fatty-acid methyl esters.
