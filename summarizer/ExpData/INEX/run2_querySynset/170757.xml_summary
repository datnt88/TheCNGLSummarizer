The planet Jupiter in particular is a large source of cyclotron radiation.
Cyclotron radiation would likely be produced in a high altitude nuclear explosion.
Radiation reaction acts as a resistance to motion in a cyclotron; and the work necessary to overcome it is the main energetic cost of accelerating a particle in a cyclotron.
