Other types of Goombas have appeared throughout the Mario series, although these largely vary from game to game.
Goombas made their first playable appearance in Mario Superstar Baseball, and again in Mario Super Sluggers, as a playable character.
Printed mediums such as Nintendo Comics System and Nintendo Adventure Books make more frequent use of them.
