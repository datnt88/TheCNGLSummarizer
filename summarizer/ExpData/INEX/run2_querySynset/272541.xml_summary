Symptoms of tenosynovitis include pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the particular joint where the inflammation occurs.
Possible treatments for tenosynovitis include cortisone injections (then a course of paracetamol and ibuprofen for pain) and an outpatient surgery to enlarge the synovium.
Repeated use of hand tools can precede the condition, as well as arthritis or injury.
