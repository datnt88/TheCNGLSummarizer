Since the First Kashmir War (1947â€“48), travel and communication between what became Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Indian-administered Kashmir were indefinitely suspended.
The Kargil War of 1999 broke out when Indian force sought to repel militants and Pakistani soldiers who had infiltrated across the LoC.
The Indian government has proposed improving travel permit procedures, increasing the frequency of the bus service to weekly instead of a fortnight, and starting bus services connecting Kargil, India, with Skardu, Pakistan, and Jammu, India, with Sialkot, Pakistan.
