The EURion constellation is a pattern of symbols found on a number of banknote designs since about 1996.
It is added to help software detect the presence of a banknote in a digital image.
The EURion constellation first described by Kuhn consists of a pattern of five small yellow, green or orange circles, which is repeated across areas of the banknote at different orientations.
