Notepad++ is a free source code editor for Windows.
This project, based on the Scintilla editor component, is written in C++ with pure Win32 API calls and uses STL. The aim of Notepad++ is to offer a slim and efficient binary with a totally customizable GUI.
Although Scintilla does not support multiline regular expression search and replace, Notepad++ does contain support for plug-ins which help mitigate this fact.
