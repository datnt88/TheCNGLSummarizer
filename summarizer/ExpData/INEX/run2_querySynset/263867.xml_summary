Beauvais was known to the Romans as Bratuspantium (gaulish name) Caesaromagus (gallo-roman name)(though the post-Renaissance Latin rendering is Bellovacum, after the name of the Celtic tribe.) and took its present name from the Belgic tribe of the Bellovaci, whose capital it was.
The episcopal palace, now used as a court-house, was built in the sixteenth century, partly upon the Gallo-Roman fortifications.
