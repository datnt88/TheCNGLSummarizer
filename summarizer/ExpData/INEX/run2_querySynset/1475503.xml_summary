Testis-determining factor (TDF) is a general term for the gene (or product thereof) that results in maleness in humans and some other species.
Embryos are gonadally identical, regardless of genetic sex, until a certain point in development; then the testis-determining factor causes male sex organs to develop, while lack of this factor will cause the embryo to develop as physically female.
The TDF factor is encoded by the SRY gene located in the Y chromosome.
