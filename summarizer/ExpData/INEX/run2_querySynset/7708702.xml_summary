Irma Bunt is the main henchwoman in the James Bond novel and film On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
Unusual for a Bond film villain, Bunt seems to have escaped punishment and retribution from 007: she did not appear in the following film, Diamonds Are Forever, where Bond avenges Tracy's death by relentlessly tracking down and killing Blofeld.
He is one of two SPECTRE henchmen who accompany Irma Bunt in her pursuit of Bond through a small town in the Alps. He and Felsen fight with Bond in a shed and are defeated by him, but Bunt recalls them to her car and they chase Bond and Tracy through a racecourse.
