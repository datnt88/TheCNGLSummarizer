The first and most obvious symptom is what feels like a sharp stone, although this does not hurt, the pain occurs about 2-3 minutes after being stung.The pain from weever stings has been described as so severe that sailors stung by the fish would cut off their stung fingers or hands in a desperate attempt to relieve the pain, this is however highly unlikely.
Lifeguards on the south coasts of England and Wales deal with weever stings almost daily, and stings are often described as "extremely painful" causing throbbing pain and swelling in the effected area and "much worse than a wasp (or bee) sting" - some victims find the comparison to wasp or bee stings offensive.
Once the pain has eased the injury should be checked for the remains of broken spines and any found need to be removed.
