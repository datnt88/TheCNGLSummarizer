One relatively recent example of Christian demonology is the book War On The Saints, by Jessie Penn-Lewis, which purports to reveal what demons are, how they work at gaining possession, how to recognize their workings, how to oppose them, and how to free oneself and others from demon possession.
Alleged victims of demonic possession may hear voices, becomes obsessed or fixated on an object or idea, develop a split personality, be impervious to reason, develop a hatred of God, or become interested in bestiality or pedophilia.
Believers say that to protect against demonic possession, one must have faith in God, an alert watchfulness, a guarding of one's own mind, and a spoken refusal of the influence of all evil spirits.
