A considerable area of Colombia is mountainous, mainly crossed by the Andes mountain range from south to north.
In the case of the Guajira Peninsula plains, the trade winds are unable to be stopped (despite having a low altitude range of mountains; the Serranía de Macuira) and continue traveling inland towards Colombia's central regions, for this reason the Guajira area present a dry climate and produced the Guajira desert.
The diversity of climates in Colombia is characterized for having tropical rainforests, savannas, steppes, deserts and mountain climate, this last one further subdivided into tierra caliente (hot land) tierra templada (temperate land) tierra fria (cold land), tierra helada (frozen land) and Páramo.
