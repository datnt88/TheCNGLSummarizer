A typical cruiser would be a young man who drives a modified car.
Modifications can take many forms including bodykits and In Car Entertainment (ICE) as represented by the likes of Max Power and Fast Car magazines, motorsport influenced modifications such as engine tuning, roll cages, race seats and harnesses, and "Euro" styling where the emphasis is on a smooth, low look with small wide wheels.
Externally from the life span, the popularity of any model can be greatly increased by a successful "hot" derivative as seen with the number of base model CitroÃ«n Saxos due to the success of the warm VTR model and hot VTS model.
