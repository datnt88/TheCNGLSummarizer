Samuel H. Wood is a scientist noted for donating DNA that was used in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to produce mature human embryos that were clones of Dr Wood.
Dr. Wood and five other researchers published their findings in the online research journal Stem Cells, in an article entitled Development of Human cloned Blastocyst Following Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT) with Adult Fibroblasts.
Miodrag StojkoviÄ‡, a researcher and peer reviewer of the paper publishing the findings, responded to critics' claims that the work is not groundbreaking:  "Stemagen's work is the first time anyone has documented that this could be done with adult skin cells."
