The most beautiful building in Verona and one of the most perfect in all Europe, the Palazzo del Consiglio, famous for the decorations of its loggia, was designed by Giocondo at the request of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor.
There he built two bridges of remarkable beauty, the Pont Notre-Dame and the Petit Pont in Paris, and designed the palace of the Chambre des Comptes, the Golden Room of the Parliament, and the Chateau of Gaillon (Normandy), one portal of which has been removed to Paris, and stood for years in the courtyard of the Ã‰cole des Beaux-Arts to serve as a model for students of architecture, and was returned in 1977.
In 1511 he edited a new edition of De Architectura of the classical Roman writer Vitruvius, a book that had a major influence on the development of Renaissance architecture.
