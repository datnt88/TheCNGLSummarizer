The Coca-Cola formula is The Coca-Cola Company's secret recipe for Coca-Cola.
To this day, Coca-Cola uses as an ingredient from coca leaf extract prepared by a Stepan Company plant in Maywood, New Jersey, using a process monitored by the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The Coca-Cola Company currently refuses to comment on the continued presence of coca leaf in Coca-Cola.
