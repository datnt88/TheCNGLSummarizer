Crystal Palace is a residential area in South London, England named from the erstwhile local landmark, The Crystal Palace, which occupied the area from 1854 to 1936.
The palace was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936 and the site of the building and its grounds is now known as Crystal Palace Park and 'once' included an olympic sized swimming pool.
Crystal Palace is accessible by rail via Crystal Palace railway station, where Southern trains run to and from Victoria and London Bridge railway stations.
