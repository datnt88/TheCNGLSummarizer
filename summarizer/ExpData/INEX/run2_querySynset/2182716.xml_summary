The physics of FTICR is similar to that of a cyclotron at least in the first approximation.
The cyclotron motion is still the frequency being used but the relationship above is not exact due to this phenomenon.
In that case the value of the radical is just slightly less than \omega_c/2 and the value of \omega _+ is just slightly less than \omega_c (the cyclotron frequency has been slightly reduced).
