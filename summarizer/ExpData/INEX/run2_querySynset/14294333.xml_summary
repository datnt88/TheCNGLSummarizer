Lieutenant General Muhammad Masood Aslam SJ (born September 1, 1952) is the principal commander of Pakistan Army fighting the pro-Taliban forces in the Waziristan theater, part of War Against Terror.
He was commissioned in the Infantry's Punjab Regiment on 14 November 1971 in the 47th PMA Long Course as his course was shortened due to Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.
This was period when Pakistan Army launched military operation against the vigilantes of Lal Masjid in Islamabad that followed with a rising trend of terrorist attacks throughout Pakistan, mostly emanating from the rugged lands of Waziristan and the surrounding tribal regions.
