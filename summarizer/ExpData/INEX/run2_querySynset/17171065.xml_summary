OPUS is the name of a rechargeable contactless stored value smart card which is being gradually introduced in most of the  public transit systems in the Canadian province of Quebec.
One card can contain up to four different kinds of fares.
The main goal behind the creation of this card is to reduce the amount of fare evasion that takes place in the province's transit systems.
