The first villain of the series, Cool Alien collects human specimens using a vaporizing / teleportation ray from his invisible spaceships.
An alien plant covered with countless thorns, Waiell uses two extraterrestrial Tilsonite 808 rocks to disguised himself as Ishiguro, a crew member of Space Station V3 who has just returned to Earth.
A gray fur covered humanoid (done with simplistic effects make-up and a fur suit), Alien Wild came to Earth to save his people, who are dying of old age, by using a camera that can entrap life forces on film, while leaving the victims' physical bodies in a deathly state.
