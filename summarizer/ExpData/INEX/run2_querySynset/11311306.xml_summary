The 1930s were years of intense cyclotron development at Berkeley under Lawrence's leadership and Thornton became a prominent member of his team.
In 1945 Thornton returned to Berkeley where he led construction of the 184-inch cyclotron, the first large frequency-modulated cyclotron that used the new concept of phase stability.
He was for a long time in charge of scheduling for the 184-inch cyclotron.
