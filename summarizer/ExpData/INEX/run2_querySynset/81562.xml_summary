John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is the d√©but solo album by English rock musician John Lennon.
John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is generally considered one of Lennon's finest solo albums and a landmark recording.
In 2000, Yoko Ono supervised a remixing of John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band for its remastered CD reissue, including two bonus tracks: Lennon's 1971 hit "Power To The People" and "Do The Oz," which had appeared on the 1998 box set John Lennon Anthology.
