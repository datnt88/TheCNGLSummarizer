As a crossover vehicle, the Edge bridges the gap between minivans like the now discontinued Freestar, and truck-based sport utility vehicles such as the Explorer.
The Edge officially slots below the Taurus X in Ford's crossover SUV lineup.
Edge's U.S. sales have increased steadily since its launch, outselling all other mid- to large-sized crossover SUVs from January to June 2007 with over 58,000 units sold.
