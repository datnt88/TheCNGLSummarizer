Eloise is a vat grown prototype Alien/humanoid android hybrid created using Queen DNA. She escapes captivity with a band of Alien warriors, with whom she settles on the planet LK176. She and her army successfully beat back both Predator and human forces, and gives the latter an ultimatum to leave her people alone, or be destroyed.
In the comic Aliens: Rogue, a mad scientist engineered the Rogue Alien: a male alien designed as a weapon to rival the queen caste and thus help rid the Earth of its alien infestation (see Earth Hive, Nightmare Asylum, Female War, and Genocide).
Various action figures have been made depicting non-canon Xenomorphs, such as the Gorilla Alien, Snake Alien, Arachnid Alien, Flying Queen Alien, and Bull Alien action figures released by Kenner Toys to coincide with the release of the SNES Alien vs. Predator Game; the Gorilla, Snake, and Flying Queen Aliens appear as boss enemies in the game.
