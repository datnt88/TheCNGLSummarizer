"The Soup Nazi" is the title of the 116th episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld, which was the 6th episode of the 7th season.
The first reference to the character (though not by name) seems to have come years before the Seinfeld episode in the 1993 movie Sleepless in Seattle.
Before the episode was written, much of the cast of Seinfeld (including Wayne Knight) had been to Soup Kitchen International.
