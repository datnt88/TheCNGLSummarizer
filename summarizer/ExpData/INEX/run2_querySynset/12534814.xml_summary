A no-carbohydrate diet (no-carb diet) is described as human carnivorism.
It excludes dietary consumption of all carbohydrates and suggests fat as the main source of energy with sufficient protein.
A no-carbohydrate diet is also a form of a ketogenic diet, any diet causing the body to go into a state of ketosis.
