Walls and Bridges is an album by John Lennon, released in October 1974.
During one of his sporadic visits from England to see his father, eleven-year-old Julian Lennon helped record a casual cover of "Ya Ya", which Lennon tacked onto the end of Walls and Bridges with the credit: "Starring Julian Lennon on drums and Dad on piano and vocals".
All songs written and composed by John Lennon, except "Old Dirt Road", by John Lennon and Harry Nilsson.
