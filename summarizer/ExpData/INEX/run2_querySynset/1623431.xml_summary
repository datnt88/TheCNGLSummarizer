Of Exorcisms and Certain Supplications (Latin: De Exorcismis et Supplicationibus Quibusdam) is an 84-page document of the Roman Catholic church describing the rite of exorcism.
It was revised on 26 January 1998, making it the last liturgical book to be revised following the Second Vatican Council of 1962-1965.
Following the trends in Catholic approaches to alleged cases of possession since the pontificate of Leo XIII in the nineteenth century, the new revision includes a warning not to confuse mental illness with demonic possession.
