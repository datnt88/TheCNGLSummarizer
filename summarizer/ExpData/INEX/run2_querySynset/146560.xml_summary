A brickfilm is any film made using LEGO, Mega Bloks, or other similar plastic construction block toys.
They are most often created with stop motion, though many CGI, 2D animation, and live action films are also considered brickfilms.
The first ever brickfilm was made between 1985-1989 in Perth, Western Australia by Lindsay Fleay.
