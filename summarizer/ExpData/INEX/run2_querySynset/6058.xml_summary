If collagen is partially hydrolyzed, the three tropocollagen strands separate into globular, random coils, producing gelatin, which is used in many foods, including flavoured gelatin desserts.
Besides food, gelatin has been used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and photography industries.
Collagen normally converts to gelatin, but survived due to the dry conditions.
