The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a 2005 horror/thriller film directed by Scott Derrickson.
The film is based on the true story of Anneliese Michel, a young Catholic woman from Germany who died in 1976 after unsuccessful attempts to cure her from the alleged state of demonic possession with the use of psychotropic drugs.
Also, a church-approved exorcism was performed on her, according to her wish.
