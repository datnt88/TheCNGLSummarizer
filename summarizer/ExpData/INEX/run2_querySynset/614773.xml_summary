Double Fantasy is the comeback album by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, released in 1980 initially on the newly-formed Geffen Records, and then from 1989 onwards through EMI. It is notable for being John Lennon's last authorised release, released only three weeks before his murder.
On the evening 8 December 1980, Mark David Chapman shot John Lennon four times as he was walking into The Dakota with Ono; Lennon died approximately twenty minutes later.
“The last time I saw John he had this incredible smile on his face,” Jack Douglas later told journalist Chris Hunt.
