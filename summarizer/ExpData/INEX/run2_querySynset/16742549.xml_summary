SAPICA (サピカ, Sapika) is a rechargeable contactless smart card ticketing system for public transport in Sapporo, Japan.
The integrated service with Kitaca, a smart card system to be introduced by JR Hokkaidō from autumn 2008, was once considered.
From 2001 to 2004, Sapporo Municipal Subway experimented a different smart card called S.M.A.P. Card (S.M.A.P.カード, Sumappu Kādo).
