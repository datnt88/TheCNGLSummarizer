Blackberry thumb is a form of repetitive strain injury caused by the frequent use of the thumb(s) to press buttons on PDAs, smart phones, or other mobile devices.
It is caused by the fact that the thumb does not have the dexterity that the other four fingers have, and is especially common in those who use these devices for such activities at high speeds comparable that of touch typing.
These injuries do not occur to users of regular computer keyboards because the other four fingers are mostly used for typing.
