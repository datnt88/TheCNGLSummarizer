A volcanic ash column rose high into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states.
As the water moved back into its basin, it pulled with it thousands of trees felled by a super-heated wall of volcanic gas and searing ash and rock that overtook the landslide seconds before.
The resulting blast laterally directed the pyroclastic flow of very hot volcanic gases, ash, and pumice formed from new lava, while pulverized old rock hugged the ground, initially moving at 220 mph (350 km/h) but quickly accelerating to 670 mph (1080 km/h) (it may have briefly passed the speed of sound).
