The names for the chemical elements 104 to 109 were the subject of a major controversy  starting in the 1960s which was finally resolved in 1997.
The controversy arose when multiple groups claimed to have discovered the same elements.
Both einsteinium and fermium were proposed as names of new elements discovered by Albert Ghiorso, Seaborg and the other American co-discoverers of those elements while Enrico Fermi and Albert Einstein were still living.
