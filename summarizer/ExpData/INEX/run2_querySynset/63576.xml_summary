Pemberton used an old family recipe from his African American maid's family for the original Coca Cola formula, as a nonalcoholic alternative to his French Wine Coca in the event that the pending national temperance movement prohibited the sale of the latter.
Pemberton was plagued by his morphine addiction and imbibed his cocawine and soda in an effort to control the addiction (both beverages contained coca leaf, of which cocaine is isolated).
However, the effects of the coca leaf is greatly compounded by the presence of caffeine from the kola nut.
