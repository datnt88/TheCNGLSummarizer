Flappy first appeared on the Sharp X1 home computer in 1983.
Two officially-unreleased variants of Flappy, Floppy and Beyond Floppy, were programmed by Greg Hale and Ted Cohn for the Apple II platform.
Included with both Apple II games was an editor which allowed the user to create their own custom levels.
