A pyrocumulus or fire cloud is a dense cumuliform cloud associated with fire or volcanic activity.
Phenomena such as  volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and occasionally industrial activities can induce formation of this cloud.
Condensation of ambient moisture (moisture already present in the atmosphere) as well as moisture evaporated from burnt vegetation or volcanic outgassing occurs readily on particles of ash.
