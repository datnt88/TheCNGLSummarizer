Widor's best-known single piece for the organ is the final movement, Toccata, from his Symphony for Organ No. 5, which is often played as a recessional at wedding ceremonies and even at the close of the Christmas Midnight Mass at Saint Peter's Basilica (The Vatican City, Rome).
The Fifth Symphony has five movements, the last of which is the famous Toccata.
The Sixth Symphony is also famous for its opening movement.
