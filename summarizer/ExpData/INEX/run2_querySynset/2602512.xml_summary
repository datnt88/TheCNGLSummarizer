The Australian Research Council (ARC) is the Australian Governmentâ€™s main agency for allocating research funding to academics and researchers in Australian universities.
The ARC also brokers partnerships between researchers and industry, government, community organisations and the international community.
Many Australian researchers and academics are critical of the ARC for what they perceive as its overly bureacratic processes.
