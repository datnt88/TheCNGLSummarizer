TSE features a very capable macro language (SemWare ApplicationLanguage or SAL), regular expression search and replace, keystroke recording and playback, full Undo/Redo, shortcut key assignment (both as configuration and on the fly) that allow extensive modification of the functionality of thetext editor, and other features expected in a modern text editor.
Qedit was a powerful DOS text editor noted for low memory consumption; blazing fast I/O and search; fast responsiveness; and a simple yet powerful text-based macro language.
TSE advanced over Qedit in several ways, including a new, richer scripting language (SAL), regular expressions, a native Win32 port, SAL access to Win32 DLL entrypoints, a 'graphical' port, optional native dialogs (e.g. Open), and even advanced graphical features such as window transparency.
