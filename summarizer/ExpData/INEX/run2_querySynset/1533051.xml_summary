An eruption column consists of hot volcanic ash emitted during an explosive volcanic eruption.
Eruption columns form in explosive volcanic activity, when the high concentration of volatile materials in the rising magma caused it to be disrupted into fine volcanic ash and coarser tephra.
Eruption columns over 10-15Â km high break through the tropopause and inject ash and aerosols into the stratosphere.
