Coordinates: 51°25′3″N 0°4′2″W﻿ / ﻿51.4175, -0.06722The Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, also known as Dinosaur Court,  are a series of sculptures of dinosaurs and extinct mammals located in Crystal Palace, London.
Following the closure of the Great Exhibition in October 1851, The Crystal Palace was bought and moved to Sydenham Hill, South London by the newly formed Crystal Palace Company; the grounds that surrounded it were then extensively renovated and turned into a public park with ornamental gardens, replicas of statues and two new man-made lakes.
By as early as 1895 experts looked on them with scorn and ridicule The Crystal Palace Dinosaurs by Steve McCarthy and Mick Gilbert quotes American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh who scorns the dinosaurs' 'friends' as doing them a great injustice and speaks angrily of the models.
