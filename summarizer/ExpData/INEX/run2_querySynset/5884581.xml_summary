Marples' Penguin (Palaeeudyptes marplesi) was a large species of the extinct penguin genus Palaeeudyptes.
It stood between 105 and 145 cm high in life, larger than the present Emperor Penguin.
The binomen of this species honors Brian J. Marples, one of the foremost researchers of fossil penguins in the 20th century.
