James Bond (also known as I Wish I Was James Bond) will be the sixth and final single from Scouting for Girls' debut album, Scouting for Girls.
The song is about the spy James Bond from Ian Fleming's books and the James Bond movies.
It is expected to be released late October/early November, presumably to coincide with the UK release of the 22nd Bond movie, Quantum of Solace.
