The 1634 case of demonic possession in Loudun, France, is arguably the most famous case of multiple or mass possession in history.
No evidences of true possession were found, and the Archbishop ordered the exorcisms to cease on March 21, 1633.
His belief was that the nuns were victims of hystero-demonopathy; sexually frustrated, they had turned their erotic desires into dreams of demonic possession by Grandier, a handsome, charismatic man who was known as a seducer of women.
