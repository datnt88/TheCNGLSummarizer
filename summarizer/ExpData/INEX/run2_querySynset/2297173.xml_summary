The M.Phil. is considered more difficult and prestigious, as it requires both a lengthy thesis as well as more examinations.
Even when the student and supervisor agree that a student should study for a PhD after the Bachelors, some supervisors recommend that the student submits an MPhil thesis at the end of his first year of study, in order to gain experience in writing a larger thesis.
This status is also called A.B.D., or All But Dissertation (or All But Done).
