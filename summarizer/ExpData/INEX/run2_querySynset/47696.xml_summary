A sport utility vehicle (SUV) is a generic marketing description for a rugged automotive vehicle similar to a station wagon but built on a light-truck chassis.
Compact SUVs and mini SUVs may have five or fewer seats, especially if they are based on a car platform instead of a light truck.
The transportation curator at the Henry Ford Museum, Robert Casey, contends persuasively that the Cherokee was the first true sport utility vehicle in the modern understanding of the term.
