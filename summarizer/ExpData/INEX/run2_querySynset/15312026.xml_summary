The Estonian 500 Krooni bill (500 EEK) is a denomination of the Estonian currency .
Carl Robert Jakobson, who was an Estonian politician, publisher, writer and promoter of agriculture (1841-1882), is featured on the front side of the bill, which is why the 500 Krooni bill is often called a "Jakobson".
The 500 Krooni bill is one of the primary banknotes (and in most cases, the main banknotes to be used in everyday shopping) dispensed by ATMs in Estonia as well as the primary bill used for withdrawals or cashing checks.
