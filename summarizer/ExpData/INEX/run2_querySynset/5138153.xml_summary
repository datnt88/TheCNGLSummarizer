Enchanted is a 2007 musical film, directed by Kevin Lima and produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures.
Similarly, film critics Richard Roeper and Michael Phillips, who gave the film positive reviews on At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper, emphasized the effect of Adams' performance on the film with remarks like "Amy Adams is this movie" and "Amy Adams shows how to make a comic clich√© work like magic." However, both agreed that the final sequence involving the computer-generated dragon of Narissa "bogged down" the film.
It also received four Teen Choice Award nominations: Choice Movie: Chick Flick, Choice Movie Actress: Comedy (for Amy Adams), Choice Movie Actor: Comedy (for James Marsden), Choice Movie: Villain (for Susan Sarandon).
