Phantom limb pain is the feeling of pain in an absent limb or a portion of a limb.
The pain sensation varies from individual to individual.
However, in 1551, French military surgeon Ambroise Paré recorded the first documentation of phantom limb pain when he reported that, “For the patients, long after the amputation is made, say that they still feel pain in the amputated part” (Bittar et al, 2005).
