"Homer's Barbershop Quartet" is the first episode of The Simpsons' fifth season.
It features the Be-Sharps, a fictional barbershop quartet founded by Homer, whose story roughly parallels that of The Beatles.
The episode was written by Jeff Martin, directed by Mark Kirkland, while George Harrison and David Crosby guest starred as themselves, and The Dapper Dans as the singing voices of "The Be-Sharps".
