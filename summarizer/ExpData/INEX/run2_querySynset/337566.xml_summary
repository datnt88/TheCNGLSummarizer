A few researchers have questioned the extent of positive effects as most studies compare moderate drinkers' health to non-drinkers, but fail to take into account the number of people who abstain because they are already ill, rather than lack of alcohol causing their ill-health.
"Among men, neuropsychological test scores were not associated with alcohol consumption in either univariate or multivariate analysis; nor didthe proportion of high cognitive performers vary by alcohol consumption. In contrast, among women, significant positive associations between alcohol consumption and cognitive performance were observed for most tests in multivariate analysis. â€¦ These findings suggest that, among women, moderate alcohol consumption may have a beneficial effect on cognitive function.
The  National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) reports that  "Although there is no evidence that alcohol itself is a carcinogen, alcohol may act as a cocarcinogen by enhancing the carcinogenic effects of other chemicals. For example, studies indicate that alcohol enhances tobacco's ability to stimulate tumor formation in rats (Garro &amp; Lieber). In humans, the risk for mouth, tracheal, and esophageal cancer is 35 times greater for people who both smoke and drink than for people who neither smoke nor drink (Blot et al.), implying a cocarcinogenic interaction between alcohol and tobacco-related carcinogens (Garro &amp; Lieber)."  One study determined that "3.6% of all cancer cases worldwide are related to alcohol drinking, resulting in 3.5% of all cancer deaths."  The NiAAA suggests that "considerable evidence suggests a connection between heavy alcohol consumption and increased risk for cancer, with an estimated 2 to 4 percent of all cancer cases thought to be caused either directly or indirectly by alcohol."
