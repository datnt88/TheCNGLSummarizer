The Optimal Diet (or Optimal Nutrition) is a high fat, low carbohydrate diet developed by Polish doctor Jan Kwasniewski.
He believes that a high carbohydrate/low fat diet, such as the Japanese diet rich in seafood, rice and vegetables, can work quite all right, if sufficient animal proteins are provided to burn off all the carbohydrates.
This works out to about 12% protein, 80% fat, and 8% carbohydrate in caloric percentages.
