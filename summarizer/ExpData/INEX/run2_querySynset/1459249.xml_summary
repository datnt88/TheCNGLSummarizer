The deposit of that landslide revealed the origin of coarse diamicts with hummocky topography at other strato volcanic cones.
The eruptions produced a light cloud, sending a plume of ash and steam up into the stratosphere to at least 30,000 feet (9,100 m), up to an unofficial level of 52,000 feet (15,849 m).
On January 29, 2006 National Weather Service Radar tracked an ash cloud at 14,000 feet (4,300 m) drifting south toward Kodiak Island.
