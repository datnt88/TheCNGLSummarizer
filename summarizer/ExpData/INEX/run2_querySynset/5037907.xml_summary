From 1993â€“1998, the police car models of Crown Victorias were officially known as Crown Victoria P71s. The current major facelift of the car was introduced in 1998.
As one of the few remaining passenger cars with body-on-frame, it is rugged, and enables inexpensive repairs after minor accidents without the need to straighten the chassis - an important benefit for a car frequently used by police forces for PIT maneuvers (ramming a car to spin it out) - making it preferable to unibody vehicles.
Although the Police Interceptor is not sold to the general public, these cars are widely available on the used car market in the US and Canada once they are no longer needed for law enforcement or fleet duty.
