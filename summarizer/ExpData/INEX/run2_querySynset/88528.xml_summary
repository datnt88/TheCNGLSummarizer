The game was initially called Super Mario RPG 2, and was first revealed at Nintendo Space World '97, a video game trade show hosted by Nintendo.
The game has often been compared to the previous Mario RPG title, . Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell judged that "Paper Mario is a vastly superior game to SMRPG", while IGN compared the game's simple plot unfavourably with the SNES game and RPGFan claimed that some of Paper Mario's story was copied from it.
Paper Mario was rated the 63rd best game made on a Nintendo system in Nintendo Power's "Top 200 Games" list, and the 13th greatest Nintendo 64 game of all time by the same magazine.
