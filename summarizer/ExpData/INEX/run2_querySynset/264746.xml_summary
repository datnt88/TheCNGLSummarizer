Saturated fat is fat that consists of triglycerides containing only saturated fatty acids.
There are several kinds of naturally occurring saturated fatty acids, their only difference being the number of carbon atoms - from 1 to 24. Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds between the carbon atoms of the fatty acid chain; hence, they are fully saturated with hydrogen atoms.
Harvard Nurses' Health Study found that diets lower in carbohydrate and higher in protein and animal fat are associated with a statistically insignificant decrease in risk of coronary heart disease in women.
