The most common culinary use for gelatin is as a main ingredient in varieties of gelatin desserts.
Agar, a vegetable product made from seaweed, is used especially in quick jelly powder mix and Asian jelly desserts, but also as an alternative that is acceptable to vegans and vegetarians.
Although many gelatin desserts incorporate fruit, some fresh fruits contain proteolytic enzymes; these enzymes cut the gelatin molecule in to peptides (protein fragments) too small to form a firm gel.
