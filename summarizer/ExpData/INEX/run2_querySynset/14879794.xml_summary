Doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1, also known as DMRT1, is a human gene.
This gene is found in a cluster with two other members of the gene family, having in common a zinc finger-like DNA-binding motif (DM domain).
The DM domain is an ancient, conserved component of the vertebrate sex-determining pathway that is also a key regulator of male development in flies and nematodes.
