Most often the injury is caused by a blow to the shoulder or by falling on an outstretched hand.
Early on arthritis of the shoulder can be managed with mild analgesics and gentle exercises, http://www.orthop.washington.edu/uw/roughshoulder/tabID__3376/ItemID__223/PageID__453/Articles/Default.aspx.Known gentle exercises include warm water therapy pool exercises that are provided by a trained and licensed physical therapist; approved land exercises to assure free movement of the arthritic area; cortisone injections (administered at the minimum of every six months according to orthopedic physicians) to reduce inflammation; ice and hot moist pact application (use of ice water machines designed to strap onto your shoulder are the most efficient way to apply ice but large ice packs commonly used for low back pain that can purchased at select pharmacies and medical supply stores are very effective; for more efficient moist heat use those granule packs sewed inside fabric and placed into a microwave oven for approximately two minutes -it is recommended that moist heat be applied upon first rising if pain exists, prior to going to bed for the night or even if you are awakened by shoulder pain during the night.
According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons ( AAOS) visits to orthopedic specialists  for shoulder pain has been rising since 1998 and in 2005 over 13 million patients sought medical care for shoulder pain, of which only 34% were related to injury .
