SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 21, also known as SOX21, is a human gene.
SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) genes encode a family of DNA-binding proteins containing a 79-amino acid HMG (high mobility group) domain that shares at least 50% sequence identity with the DNA-binding HMG box of the SRY protein (MIM 480000).
