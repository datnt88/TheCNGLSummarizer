Eugène Joseph Bozza (April 4 1905 – September 28 1991) was a French composer.
He is particularly noted for his wind writing, having composed pieces for nearly all of the winds and strings during his academic career (including the saxophone, for which his 1936 "Aria" is an important early composition).
