The BMW X5 is a mid-size crossover SUV sold by BMW since 1999.
BMW described it as a SAV (Sport Activity Vehicle) rather than an SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle), to emphasize its on-road ability despite its size.
On November 15, 2007, the IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) announced that the current X5 and X3 models were the top safety picks for all mid-size SUV models.
