Flute repertory is the general term for pieces composed for flute (particularly Western concert flute) and often played by flutists (or flautists).
The lists also do not generally include works originally written for other instruments and subsequently transcribed, adapted, or arranged for flute, unless such piece is very common in the repertory, in which case it is listed with its original instrumentation noted.
These "orchestral excerpts" are popular requirements in musical auditions for flute positions, and are often assigned individually as part of flute studies.
