Weyland-Yutani is a fictional corporation in the motion picture Alien and its sequels, often referred to simply as "The Company".
He is played by Lance Henriksen, the actor that played the android Bishop in Aliens and Alien³, suggesting that the android was modeled after him.
In the novelization of Alien³ (released before Alien vs. Predator), it is said that the Bishop android was created by a Weyland-Yutani employee named Michael Bishop, who is seen in the third film.
