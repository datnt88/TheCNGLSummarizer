Learning from MRI, PET and SPECT scanning, scientists were able to develop functional MRI (fMRI) with abilities that opened the door to direct observation of cognitive activities.
More or less concurrently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI or MR scanning) was developed.
This eliminates many of the false positives received from traditional MRI and fMRI testing.
