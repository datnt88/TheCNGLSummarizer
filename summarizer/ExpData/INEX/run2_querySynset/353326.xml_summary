The Musée de Cluny, officially known as Musée National du Moyen Âge, is a museum in Paris, France.
The structure  is perhaps the most outstanding example still extant of civic architecture in medieval Paris.
The Hôtel de Cluny is partially constructed on the remains of Gallo-Roman baths dating from the third century (known as the Thermes de Cluny ), which are famous in their own right and which may still be visited.
