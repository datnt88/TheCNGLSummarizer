T-money is a rechargeable series of cards and other "smart" devices used for paying transportation fares in and around Seoul and other areas of South Korea.
Similar to its predecessor "Seoul Bus Card", T-money can be used to pay for bus, subway and some taxi fares.
Some stores and attractions including Lotte World amusement park, Kyobo Book Centre, GS 25 and other selected convenience stores accept T-money as cash.
