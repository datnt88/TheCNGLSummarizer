In geography, arable land (from Latin arare, to plough) is an agricultural term, meaning land that can be used for growing crops.
Even if the land is over-farmed and all the nutrients are depleted from the soil, the land renews its fertility when new deposits of silt arrive following the next flood.
Non-arable land is sometimes called wasteland, badlands, worthless or no man's land.
