Sequence (or specifically text string) patterns are often described using regular expressions (i.e. backtracking) and matched using respective algorithms.
For simplicity and efficiency reasons, these tree patterns lack some features that are available in regular expressions.
At Bell Labs, Ken Thompson extended the seeking and replacing features of the QED editor to accept regular expressions.
